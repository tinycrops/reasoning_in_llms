 Abstract
 Wepresent an agentic, autonomous graph expansion framework that iteratively structures and
 refines knowledge in situ. Unlike conventional knowledge graph construction methods relying
 on static extraction or single-pass learning, our approach couples a reasoning-native large
 language model with a continually updated graph representation. At each step, the system
 actively generates new concepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and
 formulates subsequent prompts based on its evolving structure. Through this feedback-driven
 loop, the model organizes information into a scale-free network characterized by hub formation,
 stable modularity, and bridging nodes that link disparate knowledge clusters. Over hundreds
 of iterations, new nodes and edges continue to appear without saturating, while centrality
 measures and shortest path distributions evolve to yield increasingly distributed connectivity.
 Our analysis reveals emergent patterns—such as the rise of highly connected “hub” concepts
 and the shifting influence of “bridge” nodes—indicating that agentic, self-reinforcing graph
 construction can yield open-ended, coherent knowledge structures. Applied to materials
 design problems, we present compositional reasoning experiments by extracting node-specific
 and synergy-level principles to foster genuinely novel knowledge synthesis, yielding cross
domain ideas that transcend rote summarization and strengthen the framework’s potential
 for open-ended scientific discovery. We discuss other applications in scientific discovery and
 outline future directions for enhancing scalability and interpretability.

 1 Introduction
 Scientific inquiry often proceeds through an interplay of incremental refinement and transformative leaps,
 evoking broader questions of how knowledge evolves under continual reflection and questioning. In many
 accounts of discovery, sustained progress arises not from isolated insights but from an iterative process in
 which prior conclusions are revisited, expressed as generalizable ideas, refined, or even reorganized as new
 evidence and perspectives emerge [1]. Foundational work in category theory has formalized aspects of this
 recursive structuring, showing how hierarchical representations can unify diverse knowledge domains and
 enable higher-level abstractions in both the natural and social sciences [2, 3, 4]. Across engineering disciplines

 including materials science, such iterative integration of information has proven essential in synthesizing
 deeply interlinked concepts.
 Recent AI methods, however, often emphasize predictive accuracy and single-step outputs over the layered,
 self-reflective processes that characterize human problem-solving. Impressive gains in natural language
 processing, multimodal reasoning [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and materials science [13, 14, 15, 16, 17], including
 breakthroughs in molecular biology [18] and protein folding [19, 20, 21], showcase the prowess of large-scale
 models trained on vast datasets. Yet most of the early systems generate answers in a single pass, sidestepping
 the symbolic, stepwise reasoning that often underpins scientific exploration. This gap has prompted a line of
 research into modeling that explicitly incorporates relational modeling, reflection or multi-step inferences
 [2, 3, 4, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], hinting at a transition from single-shot pattern recognition to more adaptive
 synthesis of answers from first principles in ways that more closely resemble compositional mechanisms. Thus,
 a fundamental challenge now is how can we build scientific AI systems that synthesize information rather
 than memorizing it.
 Graphs offer a natural substrate for this kind of iterative knowledge building. By representing concepts and
 their relationships as a network, it becomes possible to capture higher-order structure—such as hubs, bridging
 nodes, or densely interconnected communities—that might otherwise remain implicit. This explicit relational
 format also facilitates systematic expansion: each newly added node or edge can be linked back to existing
 concepts, reshaping the network and enabling new paths of inference [29, 23, 27]. Moreover, graph-based
 abstractions can help large language models move beyond memorizing discrete facts; as nodes accumulate and
 form clusters, emergent properties may reveal cross-domain synergies or overlooked gaps in the knowledge
 space.
 Recent work suggests that standard Transformer architectures can be viewed as a form of Graph Isomorphism
 Network (GIN), where attention operates over relational structures rather than raw token sequences [23].
 Under this lens, each attention head effectively tests for isomorphisms in local neighborhoods of the graph,
 offering a principled way to capture both global and local dependencies. A category-theoretic perspective
 further bolsters this approach by providing a unified framework for compositional abstractions: nodes and
 edges can be treated as objects and morphisms, respectively, while higher-level concepts emerge from functorial
 mappings that preserve relational structure [2, 3, 4]. Taken together, these insights hint at the potential for
 compositional capabilities in AI systems, where simpler building blocks can be combined and reconfigured
 to form increasingly sophisticated representations, rather than relying on one-pass computations or static
 ontologies. By using graph-native modeling and viewing nodes and edges as composable abstractions, such a
 model may be able to recognize and reapply learned configurations in new contexts—akin to rearranging
 building blocks to form unanticipated solutions. This compositional approach, strengthened by category
theoretic insights, allows the system to not only interpolate among known scenarios but to extrapolate to
 genuinely novel configurations. In effect, graph-native attention mechanisms treat interconnected concepts
 as first-class entities, enabling the discovery of new behaviors or interactions that purely sequence-based
 methods might otherwise overlook.
 A fundamental challenge remains: How can we design AI systems that, rather than merely retrieving or
 matching existing patterns, build and refine their own knowledge structures across iterations. Recent work
 proposes that graphs can be useful strategies to endow AI models with relational capabilities[29, 23, 27] both
 within the framework of creating graph-native attention mechanisms and by training models to use graphs as
 native abstractions during learned reasoning phases. Addressing this challenge requires not only methods for
 extracting concepts but also mechanisms for dynamically organizing them so that new information reshapes
 what is already known. By endowing large language models with recursively expanding knowledge graph
 capabilities, we aim to show how stepwise reasoning can support open-ended discovery and conceptual
 reorganization. The work presented here explores how such feedback-driven graph construction may lead to
 emergent, self-organizing behaviors, shedding light on the potential for truly iterative AI approaches that align
 more closely with the evolving, integrative nature of human scientific inquiry. Earlier work on graph-native
 reasoning has demonstrated that models explicitly taught how to reason in graphs and abstractions can lead
 to systems that generalize better and are more interpretable [27].
 Here we explore whether we can push this approach toward ever-larger graphs, creating extensive in situ
 graph reasoning loops where models spend hours or days developing complex relational structures before
 responding to a task. Within such a vision, several key issues arise: Will repeated expansions naturally
 preserve the network’s relational cohesion, or risk splintering into disconnected clusters? Does the continuous
 addition of new concepts and edges maintain meaningful structure, or lead to saturation and redundancy?
 And to what extent do bridging nodes, which may initially spark interdisciplinary links, remain influential

 over hundreds of iterations? In the sections ahead, we investigate these questions by analyzing how our
 recursively expanded knowledge graphs grow and reorganize at scale—quantifying hub formation, modular
 stability, and the persistence of cross-domain connectors. Our findings suggest that, rather than collapsing
 under its own complexity, the system retains coherent, open-ended development, pointing to new possibilities
 for large-scale knowledge formation in AI-driven research for scientific exploration.
 1.1 Knowledge Graph Expansion Approaches
 Knowledge graphs are one way to organize relational understanding of the world. They have grown from
 manually curated ontologies decades ago into massive automatically constructed repositories of facts. A
 variety of methodologies have been developed for expanding knowledge graphs. Early approaches focused
 on information extraction from text using pattern-based or open-domain extractors. For example, the
 DIPRE algorithm [30] bootstrapped relational patterns from a few seed examples to extract new facts in a
 self-reinforcing loop. Similarly, the KnowItAll system [31] introduced an open-ended, autonomous “generate
and-test” paradigm to extract entity facts from the web with minimal supervision. Open Information
 Extraction methods like TextRunner [32] and ReVerb [33] further enabled unsupervised extraction of
 subject–predicate–object triples from large text corpora without requiring a predefined schema. These
 unsupervised techniques expanded knowledge graphs by harvesting new entities and relations from unstructured
 data, although they often required subsequent mapping of raw extractions to a coherent ontology.
 In parallel, research on knowledge graph completion has aimed to expand graphs by inferring missing links
 and attributes. Statistical relational learning and embedding-based models (e.g., translational embeddings
 like TransE [34]) predict new relationships by generalizing from known graph structures. Such approaches,
 3
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 while not fully unsupervised (they rely on an existing core of facts for training), can autonomously suggest
 plausible new edges to add to a knowledge graph. Complementary to embeddings, logical rule-mining systems
 such as AMIE [35] showed that high-confidence Horn rules can be extracted from an existing knowledge base
 and applied to infer new facts recursively. Traditional link prediction heuristics from network science– for
 example, preferential attachment and other graph connectivity measures– have also been used as simple
 unsupervised methods to propose new connections in knowledge networks. Together, these techniques form
 a broad toolkit for knowledge graph expansion, combining text-derived new content with graph-internal
 inference to improve a graph’s coverage and completeness.
 1.2 Recursive and Autonomous Expansion Techniques
 A notable line of work seeks to make knowledge graphs growth continuous and self-sustaining– essentially
 achieving never-ending expansion. The NELL project (Never-Ending Language Learner) [36] pioneered this
 paradigm, with a system that runs 24/7, iteratively extracting new beliefs from the web, integrating them
 into its knowledge base, and retraining itself to improve extraction competence each day. Over years of
 operation, NELL has autonomously accumulated millions of facts by coupling multiple learners (for parsing,
 classification, relation extraction, etc.) in a semi-supervised bootstrapping loop. This recursive approach uses
 the knowledge learned so far to guide future extractions, gradually expanding coverage while self-correcting
 errors; notably, NELL can even propose extensions to its ontology as new concepts emerge.
 Another milestone in autonomous knowledge graph construction was Knowledge Vault [37], which demon
strated web-scale automatic knowledge base population by fusing facts from diverse extractors with prob
abilistic inference. Knowledge Vault combined extractions from text, tables, page structure, and human
 annotations with prior knowledge from existing knowledge graphs, yielding a vast collection of candidate facts
 (on the order of 300 million) each accompanied by a calibrated probability of correctness. This approach
 showed that an ensemble of extractors, coupled with statistical fusion, can populate a knowledge graph at
 scales far beyond what manual curation or single-source extraction can achieve. Both NELL and Knowledge
 Vault illustrate the power of autonomous or weakly-supervised systems that grow a knowledge graph with
 minimal human intervention, using recursive learning and data fusion to continually expand and refine the
 knowledge repository.
 More recent research has explored agent-based and reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for knowledge
 graph expansion and reasoning. Instead of one-shot predictions, these methods allow an agent to make
 multi-hop queries or sequential decisions to discover new facts or paths in the graph. For example, some
 work [38] employ an agent that learns to navigate a knowledge graph and find multi-step relational paths,
 effectively learning to reason over the graph to answer queries. Such techniques highlight the potential of
 autonomous reasoning agents that expand knowledge by exploring connections in a guided manner (using a
 reward signal for finding correct or novel information). This idea of exploratory graph expansion aligns with
 concepts in network science, where traversing a network can reveal undiscovered links or communities. It also
 foreshadowed approaches like Graph-PReFLexOR [27] that treat reasoning as a sequential decision process,
 marked by special tokens, that can iteratively build and refine a task-specific knowledge graph.
 Applications of these expansion techniques in science and engineering domains underscore their value for
 discovery [29]. Automatically constructed knowledge graphs have been used to integrate and navigate scientific
 literature, enabling hypothesis generation by linking disparate findings. A classic example is Swanson’s manual
 discovery of a connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud’s disease, which emerged by linking two
 disjoint bodies of literature through intermediate concepts [39, 40]. Modern approaches attempt to replicate
 such cross-domain discovery in an automated way: for instance, mining biomedical literature to propose
 new drug–disease links, or building materials science knowledge graphs that connect material properties,
 processes, and applications to suggest novel materials, engineering concepts, or designs [41, 29].
 1.3 Relation to Earlier Work and Key Hypothesis
 The prior work discussed in Section 1.2 provides a foundation for our approach, which draws on the never
ending learning spirit of NELL [36] and the web-scale automation of Knowledge Vault [37] to dynamically
 grow a knowledge graph in situ as it reasons. Like those systems, it integrates information from diverse
 sources and uses iterative self-improvement. However, rather than relying on passive extraction or purely
 probabilistic link prediction, our method pairs on-the-fly logical reasoning with graph expansion within the
 construct of a graph-native reasoning LLM. This means each newly added node or edge is both informed by
 and used for the model’s next step of reasoning. Inspired in part by category theory and hierarchical inference,
 we move beyond static curation by introducing a principled, recursive reasoning loop that helps maintain
 4
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 transparency in how the knowledge graph evolves. In this sense, the work can be seen as a synthesis of
 existing ideas—continuous learning, flexible extraction, and structured reasoning—geared toward autonomous
 problem-solving in scientific domains.
 Despite substantial progress in knowledge graph expansion, many existing methods still depend on predefined
 ontologies, extensive post-processing, or reinforce only a fixed set of relations. NELL and Knowledge Vault,
 for instance, demonstrated how large-scale extraction and integration of facts can be automated, but they
 rely on established schemas or require manual oversight to refine extracted knowledge [36, 37]. Reinforcement
 learning approaches such as DeepPath [38] can efficiently navigate existing graphs but do not grow them by
 generating new concepts or hypotheses.
 By contrast, the work reported here treats reasoning as an active, recursive process that expands a knowledge
 graph while simultaneously refining its structure. This aligns with scientific and biological discovery processes,
 where knowledge is not just passively accumulated but also reorganized in light of new insights. Another
 key distinction is the integration of preference-based objectives, enabling more explicit interpretability of
 each expansion step. Methods like TransE [34] excel at capturing statistical regularities but lack an internal
 record of reasoning paths; our approach, in contrast, tracks and justifies each newly added node or relation.
 This design allows for a transparent, evolving representation that is readily applied to interdisciplinary
 exploration—such as in biomedicine [39] and materials science [41]—without depending on rigid taxonomies.
 Hence, this work goes beyond conventional graph expansion by embedding recursive reasoning directly into the
 construction process, bridging the gap between passive knowledge extraction and active discovery. As we show
 in subsequent sections, this self-expanding paradigm yields scale-free knowledge graphs in which emergent
 hubs and bridge nodes enable continuous reorganization, allowing the system to evolve its understanding
 without exhaustive supervision and paving the way for scalable hypothesis generation and autonomous
 reasoning.
 Hypothesis. We hypothesize that recursive graph expansion enables self-organizing knowledge formation,
 allowing intelligence-like behavior to emerge without predefined ontologies, external supervision, or centralized
 control. Using a pre-trained model, Graph-PReFLexOR (an autonomous graph-reasoning model trained on a
 corpus of biological and biologically inspired materials principles) we demonstrate that knowledge graphs
 can continuously expand in a structured yet open-ended manner, forming scale-free networks with emergent
 conceptual hubs and interdisciplinary bridge nodes. Our findings suggest that intelligence-like reasoning can
 arise from recursive self-organization, challenging conventional paradigms and advancing possibilities for
 autonomous scientific discovery and scalable epistemic reasoning.
 2 Results and Discussion
 We present the results of experiments in which the graph-native reasoning model engages in a continuous,
 recursive process of graph-based reasoning, expanding its knowledge graph representation autonomously over
 1,000 iterations. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a small number of just a few recursive reasoning steps,
 the experiments reported in this paper explore how knowledge formation unfolds in an open-ended manner,
 generating a dynamically evolving graph. As the system iterates, it formulates new tasks, refines reasoning
 pathways, and integrates emerging concepts, progressively structuring its own knowledge representation
 following the simple algorithmic paradigm delineated in Figure 1. The resulting graphs from all iterations
 form a final integrated knowledge graph, which we analyze for structural and conceptual insights. Figure 2
 depicts the final state of the graph, referred to as graph G1, after the full reasoning process.
 The recursive graph reasoning process can be conducted in either an open-ended setting or develoepd into a
 more tailored manner to address a specific domain or flavor in which reasoning steps are carried out (details,
 see Materials and Methods). In the example explored here, we focus on designing impact-resistant materials.
 In this specialized scenario, we initiate the model with a concise, topic-specific prompt– e.g., Describe a
 way to design impact resistant materials, and maintain the iterative process of extracting structured
 knowledge from the model’s reasoning. We refer to the resulting graph as G2. Despite the narrower focus,
 the same core principles apply: each new piece of information from the language model is parsed into nodes
 and edges, appended to a global graph, and informs the next iteration’s query. In this way, G2 captures a
 highly directed and domain-specific knowledge space while still exhibiting many of the emergent structural
 traits—such as hub formation, stable modularity, and growing connectivity—previously seen in the more
 general graph G1. Figure 3 shows the final snapshot for G2. To further examine the emergent structural
 organization of both graphs, Figures S1 and S2 display the same graphs with nodes and edges colored

 comparison against an alternative exponential distribution. A log-likelihood ratio (LR) greater than zero and
 a p-value below 0.05 indicate that the power-law distribution better explains the degree distribution than
 an exponential fit, suggesting that the network exhibits scale-free behavior. In both graphs, these criteria
 are met, supporting a scale-free classification. We observe that G1 has a power-law exponent of α = 3.0055,
 whereas G2 has a lower α = 2.6455, indicating that Graph 2 has a heavier-tailed degree distribution with a

 greater presence of high-degree nodes (hubs). The lower bound xmin is smaller in G2 (xmin = 10.0) compared
 to G1 (xmin = 24.0), suggesting that the power-law regime starts at a lower degree value, reinforcing its
 stronger scale-free characteristics.
 Other structural properties provide additional insights into the connectivity and organization of these graphs.
 The average clustering coefficients (0.1363 and 0.1434) indicate moderate levels of local connectivity, with G2
 exhibiting slightly higher clustering. The average shortest path lengths (5.1596 and 4.8984) and diameters
 (17 and 13) suggest that both graphs maintain small-world characteristics, where any node can be reached
 within a relatively short number of steps. The modularity values (0.6970 and 0.6932) indicate strong
 community structures in both graphs, implying the presence of well-defined clusters of interconnected nodes.
 These findings collectively suggest that both graphs exhibit small-world and scale-free properties, with G2
 demonstrating a stronger tendency towards scale-free behavior due to its lower exponent and smaller xmin.
 7
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 Beyond scale-free characteristics, we note that the two graphs exhibit differences in structural properties
 that influence their connectivity and community organization. We find that G1, with 3,835 nodes and 11,910
 edges, is much larger and more densely connected than G2, which has 2,180 nodes and 6,290 edges. However,
 both graphs have similar average degrees (6.2112 and 5.7706), suggesting comparable overall connectivity per
 node. The number of self-loops is slightly higher in Graph 1 (70 vs. 33), though this does not significantly
 impact global structure. The clustering coefficients (0.1363 and 0.1434) indicate moderate levels of local
 connectivity, with Graph 2 exhibiting slightly more pronounced local clustering. The small-world nature of
 both graphs is evident from their average shortest path lengths (5.1596 and 4.8984) and diameters (17 and
 13), implying efficient information flow. Modularity values (0.6970 and 0.6932) suggest both graphs have
 well-defined community structures, with Graph 1 showing marginally stronger modularity, possibly due to its
 larger size. Overall, while both graphs display small-world and scale-free properties, G2 appears to have a
 more cohesive structure with shorter paths and higher clustering, whereas G1 is larger with a slightly stronger
 community division.

 by the statistically significant preference for a power-law degree distribution over an exponential fit (log-likelihood
 ratio LR > 0 and p < 0.05). The power-law exponent (α) for G1 is 3.0055, while G2 has a lower exponent of 2.6455,
 suggesting a heavier-tailed degree distribution. The clustering coefficients (0.1363 and 0.1434) indicate the presence of

 global reachability. The high modularity values (0.6970 and 0.6932) indicate strong community structure in both
 graphs. Overall, both networks exhibit hallmark properties of scale-free networks, with G2 showing a more pronounced
 scale-free behavior due to its lower α and lower xmin.
 2.1 Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth
 We now move on to a detailed analysis of the evolution of the graph as the reasoning process unfolds over
 thinking iterations. This sheds light into how the iterative process dynamically changes the nature of the
 graph. The analysis is largely focused on G1, albeit a few key results are also included for G2. Detailed
 methods about how the various quantities are computed are included in Materials and Methods.
 Figure 4 illustrates the evolution of key structural properties of the recursively generated knowledge graph.
 The number of nodes and edges both exhibit linear growth with iterations, indicating that the reasoning
 process systematically expands the graph without saturation. The increase in edges is slightly steeper than
 that of nodes, suggesting that each new concept introduced is integrated into an increasingly dense network
 of relationships rather than remaining isolated. This continuous expansion supports the hypothesis that the
 model enables open-ended knowledge discovery through recursive self-organization.
 The average degree of the graph steadily increases, stabilizing around six edges per node. This trend signifies
 that the knowledge graph maintains a balance between exploration and connectivity, ensuring that newly
 introduced concepts remain well-integrated within the broader structure. Simultaneously, the maximum
 degree follows a non-linear trajectory, demonstrating that certain nodes become significantly more connected
 over time. This emergent hub formation is characteristic of scale-free networks and aligns with patterns
 observed in human knowledge organization, where certain concepts act as central abstractions that facilitate
 higher-order reasoning.
 8
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 The size of the largest connected component (LCC) grows proportionally with the total number of nodes,
 reinforcing the observation that the graph remains a unified, traversable structure rather than fragmenting
 into disconnected subgraphs. This property is crucial for recursive reasoning, as it ensures that the system
 retains coherence while expanding. The average clustering coefficient initially fluctuates but stabilizes around
 0.16, indicating that while localized connections are formed, the graph does not devolve into tightly clustered
 sub-networks. Instead, it maintains a relatively open structure that enables adaptive reasoning pathways.
 These findings highlight the self-organizing nature of the recursive reasoning process, wherein hierarchical
 knowledge formation emerges without the need for predefined ontologies or supervised corrections. The
 presence of conceptual hubs, increasing relational connectivity, and sustained network coherence suggest that
 the model autonomously structures knowledge in a manner that mirrors epistemic intelligence. This emergent
 organization enables the system to navigate complex knowledge spaces efficiently, reinforcing the premise
 that intelligence-like behavior can arise through recursive, feedback-driven information processing. Further
 analysis of degree distribution and centrality metrics would provide deeper insights into the exact nature of
 this evolving graph topology.

 Figure S5 illustrates the same analysis of the evolution of key structural properties of the recursively generated
 knowledge graph for graph G2, as a comparison.
 Structural Evolution of the Recursive Knowledge Graph
 Figure 5 presents the evolution of three key structural properties, including Louvain modularity, average
 shortest path length, and graph diameter, over iterations. These metrics provide deeper insights into the
 self-organizing behavior of the graph as it expands through iterative reasoning. The Louvain modularity,
 depicted in Figure 5(a), measures the strength of community structure within the graph. Initially, modularity
 increases sharply, reaching a peak around 0.75 within the first few iterations. This indicates that the early
 phases of reasoning lead to the rapid formation of well-defined conceptual clusters. As the graph expands,
 modularity stabilizes at approximately 0.70, suggesting that the system maintains distinct knowledge domains
 while allowing new interconnections to form. This behavior implies that the model preserves structural
 coherence, ensuring that the recursive expansion does not collapse existing conceptual groupings.
 The evolution of the average shortest path length (SPL), shown in Figure 5(b), provides further evidence
 of structured self-organization. Initially, the SPL increases sharply before stabilizing around 4.5–5.0. The
 initial rise reflects the introduction of new nodes that temporarily extend shortest paths before they are
 effectively integrated into the existing structure. The subsequent stabilization suggests that the recursive
 9
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 process maintains an efficient knowledge representation, ensuring that information remains accessible despite
 continuous expansion. This property is crucial for reasoning, as it implies that the system does not suffer
 from runaway growth in path lengths, preserving navigability.
 The graph diameter, illustrated in Figure 5(c), exhibits a stepwise increase, eventually stabilizing around
 16–18. The staircase-like behavior suggests that the recursive expansion occurs in structured phases, where
 certain iterations introduce concepts that temporarily extend the longest shortest path before subsequent
 refinements integrate them more effectively. This bounded expansion indicates that the system autonomously
 regulates its hierarchical growth, maintaining a balance between depth and connectivity.
 These findings reveal several emergent properties of the recursive reasoning model. The stabilization of
 modularity demonstrates the ability to autonomously maintain structured conceptual groupings, resembling
 human-like hierarchical knowledge formation. The controlled growth of the shortest path length highlights
 the system’s capacity for efficient information propagation, preventing fragmentation. We note that the
 bounded expansion of graph diameter suggests that reasoning-driven recursive self-organization is capable of
 structuring knowledge in a way that mirrors epistemic intelligence, reinforcing the hypothesis that certain
 forms of intelligent-like behavior can emerge without predefined ontologies.

 For comparison, Figure S4 presents the evolution of three key structural properties—Louvain modularity,
 average shortest path length, and graph diameter—over recursive iterations for graph G2.
 2.2 Analysis of Advanced Graph Evolution Metrics
 Figure 6 presents the evolution of six advanced structural metrics over recursive iterations, capturing higher
order properties of the self-expanding knowledge graph. These measures provide insights into network
 organization, resilience, and connectivity patterns emerging during recursive reasoning.
 Degree assortativity coefficient is a measure of the tendency of nodes to connect to others with similar degrees.
 A negative value indicates disassortativity (high-degree nodes connect to low-degree nodes), while a positive
 value suggests assortativity (nodes prefer connections to similarly connected nodes). The degree assortativity
 coefficient (Figure 6(a)) begins with a strongly negative value near −0.25, indicating a disassortative structure
 where high-degree nodes preferentially connect to low-degree nodes. Over time, assortativity increases and
 stabilizes around −0.05, suggesting a gradual shift toward a more balanced connectivity structure without
 fully transitioning to an assortative regime. This trend is consistent with the emergence of hub-like structures,
 characteristic of scale-free networks, where a few nodes accumulate a disproportionately high number of
 connections.
 The global transitivity (Figure 6(b)), measuring the fraction of closed triplets in the network, exhibits an
 initial peak near 0.35 before rapidly declining and stabilizing towards 0.10, albeit still decreasing. This
 suggests that early in the recursive reasoning process, the graph forms tightly clustered regions, likely due to
 localized conceptual groupings. As iterations progress, interconnections between distant parts of the graph
 increase, reducing local clustering and favoring long-range connectivity, a hallmark of expanding knowledge
 networks.

Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 The k-core Index defines the largest integer k for which a subgraph exists where all nodes have at least k
 connections. A higher maximum k-core index suggests a more densely interconnected core. The maximum
 k-core index (Figure 6(c)), representing the deepest level of connectivity, increases in discrete steps, reaching
 a maximum value of 11. This indicates that as the graph expands, an increasingly dense core emerges,
 reinforcing the formation of highly interconnected substructures. The stepwise progression suggests that
 specific iterations introduce structural reorganizations that significantly enhance connectivity rather than
 continuous incremental growth.
 We observe that the size of the largest k-core (Figure 6(d)) follows a similar pattern, growing in discrete steps
 and experiencing a sudden drop around iteration 700 before stabilizing again. This behavior suggests that
 the graph undergoes structural realignments, possibly due to the introduction of new reasoning pathways
 that temporarily reduce the dominance of the most connected core before further stabilization.
 Betweenness Centrality is a measure of how often a node appears on the shortest paths between other nodes.
 High betweenness suggests a critical role in information flow, while a decrease indicates decentralization and
 redundancy in pathways. The average betweenness centrality (Figure 6(e)) initially exhibits high values,
 indicating that early reasoning iterations rely heavily on specific nodes to mediate information flow. Over
 time, betweenness declines and stabilizes a bit below 0.01, suggesting that the graph becomes more navigable
 and distributed, reducing reliance on key bottleneck nodes over more iterations. This trend aligns with the
 emergence of redundant reasoning pathways, making the system more robust to localized disruptions.
 Articulation points are nodes whose removal would increase the number of disconnected components in the
 graph, meaning they serve as key bridges between different knowledge clusters. The number of articulation
 points (Figure 6(f)) steadily increases throughout iterations, reaching over 800. This suggests that as the
 knowledge graph expands, an increasing number of bridging nodes emerge, reflecting a hierarchical structure
 where key nodes maintain connectivity between distinct regions. Despite this increase, the network remains
 well connected, indicating that redundant pathways mitigate the risk of fragmentation.
 A network where the degree distribution follows a power-law, meaning most nodes have few connections,
 but a small number (hubs) have many (supporting the notion of a scale-free network). Our findings provide
 evidence that the recursive graph reasoning process spontaneously organizes into a hierarchical, scale-free
 structure, balancing local clustering, global connectivity, and efficient navigability. The noted trends in
 assortativity, core connectivity, and betweenness centrality confirm that the system optimally structures its
 knowledge representation over iterations, reinforcing the hypothesis that self-organized reasoning processes
 naturally form efficient and resilient knowledge networks.
 2.3 Evolution of Newly Connected Pairs
 Figure 7 presents the evolution of newly connected node pairs as a function of iteration, illustrating how the
 recursive reasoning process expands the knowledge graph over time. This metric captures the rate at which
 new relationships are established between nodes, providing insights into the self-organizing nature of the
 network.
 In the early iterations (0–100), the number of newly connected pairs exhibits high variance, fluctuating
 between 0 and 400 connections per iteration. This suggests that the initial phase of recursive reasoning leads
 to significant structural reorganization, where large bursts of new edges are formed as the network establishes
 its fundamental connectivity patterns. The high variability in this region indicates an exploratory phase,
 where the graph undergoes rapid adjustments to define its core structure.
 Beyond approximately 200 iterations, the number of newly connected pairs stabilizes around 500–600 per
 iteration, with only minor fluctuations. This plateau suggests that the knowledge graph has transitioned into
 a steady-state expansion phase, where new nodes and edges are integrated into an increasingly structured and
 predictable manner. Unlike random growth, this behavior indicates that the system follows a self-organized
 expansion process, reinforcing existing structures rather than disrupting them.
 The stabilization at a high connection rate suggests the emergence of hierarchical organization, where
 newly introduced nodes preferentially attach to well-established structures. This pattern aligns with the
 scale-free properties observed in other experimentally acquired knowledge networks, where central concepts
 continuously accumulate new links, strengthening core reasoning pathways. The overall trend highlights
 how recursive self-organization leads to sustained, structured knowledge expansion, rather than arbitrary or
 saturation-driven growth.

 Figure 7: Evolution of newly connected node pairs over recursive iterations, G1. Early iterations exhibit high
 variability, reflecting an exploratory phase of rapid structural reorganization. Beyond 200 iterations, the process
 stabilizes, suggesting a steady-state expansion phase with sustained connectivity formation.
 The observed transition from high-variance, exploratory graph expansion to a stable, structured growth
 phase suggests that recursive self-organization follows a process similar to human cognitive learning and
 scientific discovery. We believe that this indicates that in early iterations, the system explores diverse
 reasoning pathways, mirroring how scientific fields establish foundational concepts through broad exploration
 before refining them into structured disciplines [1]. The stabilization of connectivity beyond 200 iterations
 reflects preferential attachment dynamics, a hallmark of scale-free networks where highly connected nodes
 continue to accumulate new links, much like citation networks in academia [42]. This mechanism ensures that
 core concepts serve as attractors for further knowledge integration, reinforcing structured reasoning while
 maintaining adaptability. Importantly, the system does not exhibit saturation or stagnation, suggesting that
 open-ended knowledge discovery is possible through recursive reasoning alone, without requiring predefined
 12
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 ontologies or externally imposed constraints. This aligns with findings in AI-driven scientific hypothesis
 generation, where graph-based models dynamically infer new connections by iterating over expanding
 knowledge structures [39, 41]. The ability of the system to self-organize, expand, and refine its knowledge
 base autonomously underscores its potential as a scalable framework for automated scientific discovery and
 epistemic reasoning.
 2.4 Analysis of Node Centrality Distributions at Final Stage of Reasoning
 Next, Figure 8 presents histograms for three key centrality measures—betweenness centrality, closeness
 centrality, and eigenvector centrality—computed for the recursively generated knowledge graph, at the final
 iteration. These metrics provide insights into the role of different nodes in maintaining connectivity, network
 efficiency, and global influence.
 Figure 8(a) shows the distribution of betweenness centrality. We find the distribution of betweenness centrality
 to be highly skewed, with the majority of nodes exhibiting values close to zero. Only a small fraction of nodes
 attain significantly higher centrality values, indicating that very few nodes serve as critical intermediaries for
 shortest paths. This pattern is characteristic of hierarchical or scale-free networks, where a small number
 of hub nodes facilitate global connectivity, while most nodes remain peripheral. The presence of a few
 high-betweenness outliers suggests that key nodes emerge as crucial mediators of information flow, reinforcing
 the hypothesis that self-organizing structures lead to the formation of highly connected bridging nodes.
 Figure 8(b) depicts the closeness centrality distribution. It follows an approximately normal distribution
 centered around 0.20, suggesting that most nodes remain well-connected within the network. This result
 implies that the network maintains a compact structure, allowing for efficient navigation between nodes
 despite continuous expansion. The relatively low spread indicates that the recursive reasoning process prevents
 excessive distance growth, ensuring that newly introduced nodes do not become isolated. This reinforces the
 observation that the graph remains navigable as it evolves, an essential property for maintaining coherent
 reasoning pathways.
 Next, Figure 8(c) shows the eigenvector centrality distribution, identified to be also highly skewed, with most
 nodes having values close to zero. However, a few nodes attain substantially higher eigenvector centrality
 scores, indicating that only a select few nodes dominate the network in terms of global influence. This suggests
 that the network naturally organizes into a hierarchical structure, where dominant hubs accumulate influence
 over time, while the majority of nodes play a more peripheral role. The emergence of high-eigenvector
 hubs aligns with scale-free network behavior, further supporting the idea that reasoning-driven recursive
 self-organization leads to structured knowledge representation.
 These findings indicate that the recursive knowledge graph balances global connectivity and local modularity,
 self-organizing into a structured yet efficient system. The few high-betweenness nodes act as key mediators,
 while the closeness centrality distribution suggests that the network remains efficiently connected. The
 eigenvector centrality pattern highlights the formation of dominant conceptual hubs, reinforcing the presence
 of hierarchical knowledge organization within the evolving reasoning framework.

 indicating that the majority of nodes remain well-connected; (c) Eigenvector centrality, revealing the emergence of
 dominant hub nodes. These distributions highlight the hierarchical and scale-free nature of the evolving knowledge
 graph.
 13
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 Figure 9 presents the distribution of sampled shortest path lengths. This distribution provides insights into
 the overall compactness, navigability, and structural efficiency of the network.
 The histogram reveals that the most frequent shortest path length is centered around 5–6 steps, indicating
 that the majority of node pairs are relatively close in the network. The distribution follows a bell-shaped
 pattern, suggesting a typical range of distances between nodes, with a slight right skew where some paths
 extend beyond 10 steps. The presence of longer paths implies that certain nodes remain in the periphery or
 are indirectly connected to the core reasoning structure.
 The relatively narrow range of shortest path lengths affirms that the network remains well-integrated, ensuring
 efficient knowledge propagation and retrieval. The absence of extreme outliers suggests that the recursive
 expansion process does not lead to fragmented or sparsely connected regions. This structure contrasts with
 purely random graphs, where shortest path lengths typically exhibit a narrower peak at lower values. The
 broader peak observed here suggests that the model does not generate arbitrary connections but instead
 organizes knowledge in a structured manner, balancing global integration with local modularity.
 The observed path length distribution supports the hypothesis that recursive graph reasoning constructs an
 efficiently connected knowledge framework, where most concepts can be accessed within a small number of
 steps. The presence of some longer paths further suggests that the network exhibits hierarchical expansion,
 with certain areas developing as specialized subdomains that extend outward from the core structure.

 (b)
 Figure 9: Distribution of sampled shortest path lengths in the recursively generated knowledge graphs (panel (a), for
 graph G2, panel (b), graph G2). The peak around 5–6 steps suggests that the network remains compact and navigable,
 while the slight right skew especially in panel (a) indicates the presence of peripheral nodes or specialized subdomains.
 2.5 Knowledge Graph Evolution and Conceptual Breakthroughs
 The evolution of the knowledge graph over iterative expansions discussed so far reveals distinct patterns
 in knowledge accumulation, conceptual breakthroughs, and interdisciplinary integration. To analyze these
 processes, we now examine (i) the growth trajectories of major conceptual hubs, (ii) the emergence of new
 highly connected nodes, and (iii) overall network connectivity trends across iterations. The results of these
 analyses are presented in Figure 11, which consists of three sub-components.
 The trajectory of hub development (Figure 10(a)) suggests two primary modes of knowledge accumulation:
 steady growth and conceptual breakthroughs. Certain concepts, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)
 and Knowledge Graphs, exhibit continuous incremental expansion, reflecting their persistent relevance
 in structuring knowledge. In contrast, hubs like Bioluminescent Technology and Urban Ecosystems
 experience extended periods of low connectivity followed by sudden increases in node degree, suggesting
 moments when these concepts became structurally significant in the knowledge graph. These results indicate
 that the system does not expand knowledge in a purely linear fashion but undergoes phases of conceptual
 restructuring, akin to punctuated equilibrium in scientific development.
 The emergence of new hubs (Figure 10(b)) further supports this interpretation. Instead of a continuous influx
 of new central concepts, we observe discrete bursts of hub formation occurring at specific iteration milestones.
 These bursts likely correspond to the accumulation of contextual knowledge reaching a critical threshold, after
 which the system autonomously generates new organizing principles to structure its expanding knowledge
 base. This finding suggests that the system’s reasoning process undergoes alternating cycles of consolidation
 and discovery, where previously formed knowledge stabilizes before new abstract concepts emerge.

 hubs, showing both steady accumulation and sudden breakthroughs. (b) Histogram of newly emerging high-degree
 nodes across iterations, indicating phases of conceptual expansion. (c) Plot of the mean node degree over time,
 illustrating the system’s progressive integration of new knowledge.
 The overall network connectivity trends (Figure 10(c)) demonstrate a steady increase in average node degree,
 indicating that the graph maintains a structurally stable expansion while integrating additional knowledge.
 The absence of abrupt drops in connectivity suggests that previously introduced concepts remain relevant
 and continue to influence reasoning rather than become obsolete. This trend supports the hypothesis that
 the system exhibits self-organizing knowledge structures, continuously refining its conceptual hierarchy as it
 expands.
 These observations lead to several overarching conclusions. First, the results indicate that the system
 follows a hybrid knowledge expansion model, combining gradual accumulation with disruptive conceptual
 breakthroughs. This behavior closely mirrors the dynamics of human knowledge formation, where foundational
 ideas develop progressively, but major paradigm shifts occur when conceptual thresholds are crossed. Second,
 the persistence of high-degree hubs suggests that knowledge graphs generated in this manner do not suffer
 from catastrophic forgetting; instead, they maintain and reinforce previously established structures while
 integrating new insights. Third, the formation of new hubs in discrete bursts implies that knowledge expansion
 is not driven by uniform growth but by self-reinforcing epistemic structures, where accumulated reasoning
 reaches a tipping point that necessitates new abstract representations.
 Additionally, the system demonstrates a structured directionality in knowledge formation, as evidenced by
 the smooth increase in average node degree without fragmentation. This suggests that new concepts do
 not disrupt existing structures but are incrementally woven into the broader network. Such behavior is
 characteristic of self-organizing knowledge systems, where conceptual evolution follows a dynamic yet cohesive
 trajectory. The model also exhibits potential for cross-domain knowledge synthesis, as indicated by the
 presence of nodes that transition into highly connected hubs later in the process. These nodes likely act as
 bridges between previously distinct knowledge clusters, fostering interdisciplinary connections.
 15
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 These analyses provide strong evidence that the recursive graph expansion model is capable of simulating
 key characteristics of scientific knowledge formation. The presence of alternating stability and breakthrough
 phases, the hierarchical organization of concepts, and the increasing connectivity across knowledge domains
 all highlight the potential for autonomous reasoning systems to construct, refine, and reorganize knowledge
 representations dynamically. Future research could potentially focus on exploring the role of interdisciplinary
 bridge nodes, analyzing the hierarchical depth of reasoning paths, and examining whether the system can
 autonomously infer meta-theoretical insights from its evolving knowledge graph.
 2.6 Structural Evolution of the Knowledge Graph
 The expansion of the knowledge graph over iterative refinements reveals emergent structural patterns that
 highlight how knowledge communities form, how interdisciplinary connections evolve, and how reasoning
 complexity changes over time. These dynamics provide insight into how autonomous knowledge expansion
 follows systematic self-organization rather than random accumulation. Figure 11 presents three key trends:
 (a) the formation and growth of knowledge sub-networks, (b) the number of bridge nodes that connect
 different knowledge domains, and (c) the depth of multi-hop reasoning over iterations.

 (c)
 (b)
 Figure 11: Structural evolution of the knowledge graph across iterations. (a) The number of distinct knowledge
 communities over time, showing an increasing trend with some fluctuations, for graph G1. (b) The growth of bridge
 nodes that connect multiple knowledge domains, following a steady linear increase. (c) The average shortest path
 length over iterations, indicating shifts in reasoning complexity as the graph expands.
 Figure 11(a) illustrates the formation of knowledge sub-networks over time. The number of distinct commu
nities increases as iterations progress, reflecting the system’s ability to differentiate between specialized fields
 of knowledge. The trend suggests two key observations: (i) an early rapid formation of new communities
 as novel knowledge domains emerge and (ii) a later stage where the number of communities stabilizes with
 occasional fluctuations. The latter behavior indicates that rather than indefinitely forming new disconnected
 knowledge clusters, the system reaches a regime where previously distinct domains remain relatively stable
 while undergoing minor structural reorganizations. The fluctuations in the later stages may correspond to
 moments where knowledge clusters merge or when new abstractions cause domain shifts.
 Figure 11(b) tracks the number of bridge nodes (concepts that serve as interdisciplinary connectors) over
 iterative expansions. The steady, almost linear increase in bridge nodes suggests that as knowledge expands,
 16
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 more concepts naturally emerge as crucial links between different domains. This behavior reflects the
 self-reinforcing nature of knowledge integration, where new ideas not only expand within their respective fields
 but also introduce new ways to connect previously unrelated disciplines. Interestingly, there is no evidence of
 saturation in the number of bridge nodes, implying that the graph remains highly adaptive, continuously
 uncovering interdisciplinary relationships without premature convergence. This property is reminiscent of
 human knowledge structures, where interdisciplinary connections become more prevalent as scientific inquiry
 deepens.
 Figure 11(c) examines the depth of multi-hop reasoning over iterations by measuring the average shortest
 path length in the graph. Initially, reasoning depth fluctuates significantly, which corresponds to the early
 phase of knowledge graph formation when structural organization is still emergent. As iterations progress,
 the average path length stabilizes, indicating that the system achieves a balance between hierarchical depth
 and accessibility of information. The early fluctuations may be attributed to the rapid reorganization of
 knowledge, where some paths temporarily become longer as new concepts emerge before stabilizing into more
 efficient reasoning structures. The eventual stabilization suggests that the graph reaches an equilibrium in
 how information propagates through interconnected domains, maintaining reasoning efficiency while still
 allowing for complex inferential pathways.
 Taken together, these findings suggest that the autonomous knowledge expansion model exhibits structured
 self-organization, balancing specialization and integration. The interplay between distinct community
 formation, interdisciplinary connectivity, and reasoning depth highlights the emergence of a dynamically
 evolving but structurally coherent knowledge network. The continuous increase in bridge nodes reinforces
 the idea that interdisciplinary reasoning remains a central feature throughout the system’s expansion, which
 may have significant implications for autonomous discovery processes. Future analyses will explore whether
 certain bridge nodes exhibit long-term persistence as central knowledge connectors or if interdisciplinary
 pathways evolve dynamically based on newly introduced concepts.
 2.7 Persistence of Bridge Nodes in Knowledge Evolution
 To understand the structural stability of interdisciplinary connections, we further analyze the persistence of
 bridge nodes—concepts that act as connectors between distinct knowledge domains, over multiple iterations.
 Figure 12 presents a histogram of bridge node lifespans, showing how long each node remained an active
 bridge in the knowledge graph.
 Figure 12: Histogram of bridge node persistence over iterations, for G1. The distribution follows a long-tail pattern,
 indicating that while most bridge nodes exist only briefly, a subset remains active across hundreds of iterations.
 The distribution in Figure 12 suggests that knowledge graph connectivity follows a hybrid model of structural
 evolution. The majority of bridge nodes appear only for a limited number of iterations, reinforcing the
 hypothesis that interdisciplinary pathways frequently evolve as new concepts emerge and replace older ones.
 This aligns with earlier observations that the knowledge system exhibits a high degree of conceptual dynamism.
 17
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 However, a subset of bridge nodes remains persistent for hundreds of iterations. These nodes likely correspond
 to fundamental concepts that sustain long-term interdisciplinary connectivity. Their extended presence
 suggests that the system does not solely undergo continuous restructuring; rather, it maintains a set of core
 concepts that act as stable anchors in the evolving knowledge landscape.
 These results refine our earlier observations by distinguishing between transient interdisciplinary connections
 and long-term structural stability. While knowledge graph expansion is dynamic, certain foundational concepts
 maintain their bridging role, structuring the broader knowledge network over extended periods. This hybrid
 model suggests that autonomous knowledge expansion does not operate under complete conceptual turnover
 but instead converges toward the emergence of stable, high-impact concepts that persist across iterations.
 Related questions that could be explored in future research is whether these persistent bridge nodes correspond
 to widely used theoretical frameworks, methodological paradigms, or cross-domain knowledge principles.
 Additionally, further analysis is needed to examine whether long-term bridge nodes exhibit distinct topological
 properties, such as higher degree centrality or clustering coefficients, compared to short-lived connectors.
 2.8 Early Evolution of Bridge Nodes in Knowledge Expansion
 To examine the mechanics of the formation of interdisciplinary connections in the early stages of knowledge
 graph evolution, we pay close attention to the process. In the analysis discussed here, we identify the first
 occurrences of bridge nodes over the initial 200 iterations. Figure 13 presents a binary heatmap, where each
 row represents a bridge node, and each column corresponds to an iteration. The bridge nodes are sorted
 by the iteration in which they first appeared, providing a clearer view of how interdisciplinary connectors
 emerge over time.
 The heatmap in Figure 13 reveals several key trends in the evolution of bridge nodes. Notably, the earliest
 iterations feature a rapid influx of bridge nodes, reflecting the initial structuring phase of the knowledge
 graph. Many nodes appear and remain active for extended periods, suggesting that certain concepts establish
 themselves as core interdisciplinary connectors early in the process. These nodes likely play a foundational
 role in structuring knowledge integration across domains.
 Asecond notable pattern is the episodic emergence of new bridge nodes, rather than a continuous accumulation.
 The visualization shows distinct clusters of newly appearing bridge nodes, interspersed with periods of relative
 stability. These bursts suggest that knowledge integration occurs in structured phases rather than through
 gradual accumulation. Such phases may represent moments when the system reaches a threshold where newly
 integrated concepts allow for the creation of previously infeasible interdisciplinary links.
 In contrast to the early-established bridge nodes, a subset of nodes appears only in later iterations. These
 late-emerging bridge nodes indicate that interdisciplinary roles are notably not static; rather, the system
 continuously restructures itself, incorporating new ideas as they gain relevance. This supports the hypothesis
 that certain bridge nodes emerge not from initial structuring but from later stages of conceptual refinement,
 possibly as higher-order abstractions connecting previously developed knowledge clusters.
 The distribution of bridge node activity also suggests a mix of persistent and transient connectors. While some
 nodes appear briefly and disappear, others remain active over long stretches. This behavior reinforces the idea
 that knowledge expansion is both dynamic and structured, balancing exploration (where new connections are
 tested) and stabilization (where key interdisciplinary links persist).
 We note that the structured emergence of bridge nodes may indicate that interdisciplinary pathways do
 not form randomly but are shaped by systematic phases of knowledge integration and refinement. Future
 analyses could explore the long-term impact of early bridge nodes, assessing whether they remain influential
 throughout the knowledge graph’s evolution, and whether the structure of interdisciplinary connectivity
 stabilizes or continues to reorganize over extended iterations.
 2.9 Evolution of Key Bridge Nodes Over Iterations
 To investigate how interdisciplinary pathways evolve in the knowledge graph, we analyzed the betweenness
 centrality of the most influential bridge nodes across 1,000 iterations. Figure 14 presents the trajectory of the
 top 10 bridge nodes, highlighting their shifting roles in facilitating interdisciplinary connections.
 The trends in Figure 14 reveal distinct patterns in how bridge nodes emerge, peak in influence, and decline
 over time. Notably, nodes such as Closed-Loop Life Cycle Design and Human Well-being exhibit high
 betweenness centrality in the early iterations, suggesting that they played a fundamental role in structuring
 18
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 Figure 13: Emergence of bridge nodes over the first 200 iterations, sorted by first appearance, for G1. White regions
 indicate the absence of a node as a bridge, while dark blue regions denote its presence. Nodes that appear earlier
 in the graph evolution are positioned at the top. The structured emergence pattern suggests phases of knowledge
 expansion and stabilization.
 the initial interdisciplinary landscape. However, as the knowledge graph expanded, these nodes saw a gradual
 decline in their centrality, indicating that their role as primary connectors was replaced by alternative
 pathways.
 A second class of bridge nodes, including Adaptability and Resilience of Cities and Artificial
 Intelligence (AI), maintained high centrality values for a longer duration, suggesting that certain concepts
 remain essential to interdisciplinary knowledge integration even as the graph evolves. These nodes acted as
 long-term knowledge stabilizers, facilitating interactions between different research domains throughout a
 significant portion of the knowledge expansion process.
 Interestingly, a subset of nodes, such as Feedback Mechanism and Outcome, gradually gained importance
 over time. Unlike early bridge nodes that peaked and declined, these nodes started with lower centrality but
 19
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 Figure 14: Evolution of the top 10 bridge nodes over iterations, for G1. Each curve represents the betweenness
 centrality of a bridge node, indicating its role in facilitating knowledge integration. Nodes that initially had high
 centrality later declined, while some concepts maintained their influence throughout the graph’s evolution.
 increased in influence in later iterations. This suggests that some interdisciplinary pathways only become
 critical after sufficient knowledge accumulation, reinforcing the idea that interdisciplinary roles are not static
 but continuously reorganize as the knowledge graph matures.
 Furthermore, we observe that by approximately iteration 400-600, most bridge nodes’ betweenness centrality
 values begin converging toward lower values, indicating that knowledge transfer is no longer reliant on a
 small set of nodes. This suggests that, as the graph expands, alternative pathways develop, leading to a more
 distributed and decentralized knowledge structure where connectivity is no longer dominated by a few highly
 influential nodes.
 These findings support the hypothesis that interdisciplinary pathways evolve dynamically, with early-stage
 knowledge formation relying on a few key concepts, followed by a transition to a more robust and distributed
 network where multiple redundant pathways exist. Future analyses will focus on:
 • Identifying which nodes replaced early bridge nodes as major interdisciplinary connectors in later
 iterations.
 • Comparing early vs. late-stage bridge nodes to assess whether earlier nodes tend to be general
 concepts, while later bridge nodes represent more specialized interdisciplinary knowledge.
 • Analyzing the resilience of the knowledge graph by simulating the removal of early bridge nodes to
 determine their structural significance.
 These results provide a perspective on how interdisciplinary linkages emerge, stabilize, and reorganize over
 time, offering insights into the self-organizing properties of large-scale knowledge systems.
 2.10 Evolution of Betweenness Centrality Distribution
 To analyze the structural evolution of the knowledge graph, we next examine the distribution of betweenness
 centrality at different iterations. Betweenness centrality is a measure of a node’s importance in facilitating
 knowledge transfer between different parts of the network. Formally, the betweenness centrality of a node v
 is given by:
 CB(v) =
 s=v=t
 σst(v)
 σst 
,
 (1)
 20
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 where σst is the total number of shortest paths between nodes s and t, and σst(v) is the number of those paths
 that pass through v. A higher betweenness centrality indicates that a node serves as a critical intermediary
 in connecting disparate knowledge domains.
 Figure S3 presents histograms of betweenness centrality distribution at four key iterations (2, 100, 510, and
 1024), illustrating the shifting role of bridge nodes over time.
 Initially, at Iteration 2, the network is highly centralized, with a small number of nodes exhibiting extremely
 high betweenness centrality (above 0.6), while the majority of nodes have near-zero values. This indicates
 that only a few nodes act as critical interdisciplinary connectors, facilitating nearly all knowledge transfer.
 By Iteration 100, the distribution has broadened, meaning that more nodes participate in knowledge transfer.
 The highest betweenness values have decreased compared to Iteration 2, and more nodes exhibit low but
 nonzero centrality, suggesting an increase in redundant pathways and reduced dependency on a few dominant
 bridge nodes.
 At Iteration 510, the distribution becomes more skewed again, with fewer nodes having high betweenness
 centrality and a stronger concentration at low values. This suggests that the network has undergone a phase
 of structural consolidation, where interdisciplinary pathways reorganize around fewer, more stable bridges.
 Finally, at Iteration 1024, the histogram shows that most nodes have low betweenness centrality, and only a
 few retain moderate values. This suggests that the network has matured into a more distributed structure,
 where no single node dominates knowledge transfer. The observed trend indicates that as the knowledge
 graph expands, the burden of interdisciplinary connectivity is increasingly shared among many nodes rather
 than concentrated in a few.
 These results suggest that the system undergoes a dynamic reorganization process, shifting from an initial
 hub-dominated structure to a more distributed and resilient network. Future work could potentially explore
 whether these trends continue as the graph scales further and whether the eventual network state remains
 stable or undergoes additional restructuring.
 To examine the overall structural properties of the knowledge graph, we analyzed the distribution of
 betweenness centrality across all iterations. Figure 15 presents a histogram of betweenness centrality values
 collected from all iterations of the knowledge graph. The distribution was generated by computing betweenness
 centrality for each iteration and aggregating all node values overall iterations.
 Figure 15: Distribution of betweenness centrality across all iterations, G1. The y-axis is log-scaled, showing the
 frequency of nodes with different centrality values. A small number of nodes dominate knowledge transfer, while most
 nodes exhibit near-zero centrality.
 The histogram in Figure 15 reveals a highly skewed distribution, where the majority of nodes exhibit near-zero
 betweenness centrality, while a small subset maintains significantly higher values. This pattern suggests
 that knowledge transfer within the network is primarily governed by a few dominant bridge nodes, which
 21
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 facilitate interdisciplinary connections. The presence of a long tail in the distribution indicates that these
 high-betweenness nodes persist throughout multiple iterations.
 Interestingly, the distribution also exhibits multiple peaks, suggesting that the network consists of different
 classes of bridge nodes. Some nodes act as long-term stable interdisciplinary connectors, while others emerge
 as transient bridges that facilitate knowledge transfer only for limited iterations.
 The log scale on the y-axis reveals that while most nodes contribute little to betweenness centrality, a
 significant number of nodes still exhibit low but nonzero values indicating that knowledge flow is distributed
 across many minor pathways. Over multiple iterations, it is expected that betweenness centrality values
 redistribute, reducing dependency on early dominant nodes and leading to a more decentralized knowledge
 structure.
 These findings highlight that the knowledge graph maintains a core-periphery structure, where a few key
 nodes play a disproportionate role in bridging knowledge across disciplines. Future work will explore how the
 distribution evolves over time, identifying whether the network transitions toward a more evenly distributed
 structure or remains reliant on a small number of high-centrality nodes.
 2.11 Evolution of Betweenness Centrality in the Knowledge Graph
 To analyze the structural evolution of the knowledge graph, we tracked the changes in betweenness centrality
 over 1,000 iterations. Betweenness centrality quantifies the extent to which a node serves as a bridge
 between other nodes by appearing on shortest paths. A node with high betweenness centrality facilitates
 interdisciplinary knowledge transfer by linking otherwise disconnected regions of the network. Figures 16(a)
 and 16(b) illustrate how mean and maximum betweenness centrality evolve over time. The first plot captures
 the average importance of nodes in knowledge transfer, while the second identifies the most dominant bridge
 nodes at each iteration.
 (a)
 (b)
 Figure 16: Evolution of betweenness centrality in the knowledge graph, G1. Panel (a): Mean betweenness centrality
 over time, showing a transition from early high centralization to a more distributed state. Panel (b): Maximum
 betweenness centrality per iteration, highlighting how the most dominant bridge nodes shift and decline in influence.
 Figure 16(a) tracks the mean betweenness centrality, providing insight into how the overall distribution of
 knowledge transfer roles evolves. In the earliest iterations, the mean betweenness is extremely high, indicating
 that only a few nodes dominate knowledge exchange. However, as the graph expands and alternative pathways
 form, the mean betweenness declines rapidly within the first 100 iterations.
 Between iterations 100 and 500, we observe a continued decline, but at a slower rate. This suggests that
 knowledge transfer is being shared across more nodes, reducing reliance on a small set of dominant bridges.
 After iteration 500, the values stabilize near zero, indicating that the network has reached a decentralized
 state, where multiple nodes contribute to knowledge integration instead of a few key intermediaries.
 These trends suggest a self-organizing process, where the knowledge graph transitions from a highly centralized
 system into a more distributed and resilient network. The final structure is more robust, with many small
 bridges collectively supporting interdisciplinary connectivity instead of a few dominant hubs.
 22
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 Figure 16(b) examines the highest betweenness centrality recorded in each iteration, tracking the most
 dominant knowledge bridge at each stage. In the earliest iterations, a single node reaches an extreme
 betweenness value of around 0.7, indicating that knowledge transfer is highly bottlenecked through one or
 very few key nodes.
 Between iterations 50 and 300, the maximum betweenness remains high, fluctuating between 0.3 and 0.5.
 This suggests that while the network becomes less dependent on a single node, a small number of highly
 central nodes still dominate knowledge flow. This phase represents a transition period, where the network
 starts distributing knowledge transfer across multiple nodes.
 After iteration 500, the maximum betweenness exhibits a gradual decline, eventually stabilizing around 0.2.
 This suggests that the network has successfully decentralized, and knowledge transfer is no longer dominated
 by a single key node. The presence of multiple lower-betweenness bridge nodes implies that redundant
 pathways have developed, making the system more resilient to disruptions. This is in general agreement with
 earlier observations.
 The combined results from Figures 16(a) and 16(b) suggest that the knowledge graph undergoes a fundamental
 structural transformation over time:
 • Initially, a few dominant nodes control knowledge flow, leading to high mean and maximum between
ness centrality.
 • As the graph expands, new pathways emerge, and betweenness is distributed across more nodes.
 • By the later iterations, no single node dominates, and knowledge transfer occurs through a decentral
ized structure.
 This evolution suggests that the knowledge graph self-organizes into a more distributed state, where interdis
ciplinary connectivity is no longer constrained by a few central hubs. Future studies can explore whether this
 trend continues at larger scales and analyze which specific nodes maintained high betweenness longest and
 which replaced them in later iterations.
 2.12 Analysis of longest shortest path in G2 and analysis using agentic reasoning
 While the primary focus of this study is targeting a detailed analysis of graph dynamic experiments during
 reasoning, we also explore how graph reasoning based on the in-situ generated graph can be used to
 improve responses through in-context learning [11] (here, we use meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct).
 The methodology employs a graph-based reasoning framework to enhance LLM responses through structured
 knowledge extraction obtained through the method described above. Figure 17(b) depicts additional analysis,
 showing a correlation heatmap of path-level metrics, computed for the first 30 longest shortest paths.
 The extracted longest shortest path depicted in Figure 17(a) presents a compelling sequence of relation
ships spanning biotechnology, artificial intelligence, materials science, and sustainability, illustrating how
 advancements in one domain influence others. The overall logical flow is well-structured, with clear and ex
pected progressions, such as Rare Genetic Disorders leading to Personalized Medicine and Knowledge
 Discovery, reflecting that the model captures the increasing role of AI in medical research. The sequence
 from AI Techniques to Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms is similarly intu
itive, as computational models underpin predictive simulations across disciplines (details on methods, see
 Section 4.5).
 However, some unexpected connections emerge, suggesting areas for further exploration. The link from
 Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms to Impact-Resistant Materials stands out– not as a weak connec
tion, but as an intriguing suggestion of AI-driven materials design rather than mere discovery. Computational
 techniques, such as reinforcement learning and generative modeling, could optimize material structures for
 durability, opening new pathways in materials engineering. Another unconventional relationship is the transi
tion from Biodegradable Microplastic Materials to Infrastructure Design. These two areas typically
 operate separately, yet this link may hint at the emergence of biodegradable composites for construction
 or sustainable materials engineering. Further investigation into the practical applications of biodegradable
 materials in structural design could strengthen this connection.
 A notable redundancy appears in the presence of Pollution Mitigation twice, spelled differently, which
 results from a lack of node merging rather than a distinct conceptual relationship. This duplication suggests
 that similar concepts are being represented as separate nodes, potentially affecting graph-based reasoning.
 Similarly, Self-Healing Materials in Infrastructure Design loops back to Pollution Mitigation,

 Figure 17: Longest shortest path analysis. Panel (a): Visualization of the longest shortest path (diameter path) in
 G2, presenting a fascinating chain of interdisciplinary relationships across medicine, data science and AI, materials
 science, sustainability, and infrastructure. Panel (b): Correlation heatmap of path-level metrics, computed for the first
 30 longest shortest paths. Degree and betweenness centrality are highly correlated, indicating that high-degree nodes
 frequently serve as key connectors. Eigenvector centrality and PageRank also show strong correlation, highlighting
 their shared role in capturing node influence. Path density exhibits a weak or negative correlation with centrality
 measures, suggesting that highly connected nodes often form less dense structures. The metrics were computed for each
 path by extracting node-level properties (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality, PageRank, clustering
 coefficient) from the original graph and averaging them over all nodes in the path. Path density was calculated as the
 ratio of actual edges to possible edges within the path subgraph. Correlations were then derived from these aggregated
 values across multiple paths.
 reinforcing an already established sustainability link. While valid, this repetition could be streamlined for
 clarity.
 We find that the logical progression effectively captures key interdisciplinary relationships while revealing
 areas for refinement. The structure underscores the increasing role of AI in materials science, the integration
 of sustainability into materials design, and the interplay between predictive modeling and physical sciences.
 Addressing node duplication and refining transitions between traditionally separate fields—such as biodegrad
able materials in construction—would enhance the clarity and coherence of the path, making it an even more
 insightful representation of scientific knowledge.
 Agentic Reasoning over the Path We apply an agentic model to analyze the longest shortest path.
 For this analysis, an agentic system first analyzes each node in the subgraph, then each of the relationships,
 and then synthesizes them into a “Final Synthesized Discovery” (in blue font for clarity). The analysis
 identifies key concepts such as biodegradable microplastics, self-healing materials, pollution mitigation,
 and AI-driven predictive modeling, ultimately synthesizing the Bio-Inspired, Adaptive Materials for
 Resilient Ecosystems (BAMES) paradigm. The resulting document, Supporting Text 1, presents the results.
 The proposed discovery proposes self-healing, bio-inspired materials that integrate microbial, plant, and
 animal-derived mechanisms with AI-driven optimization to create adaptive, environmentally responsive
 materials. By embedding microorganisms for pollutant degradation and leveraging machine learning for
 real-time optimization, the model suggests that BAMES extends conventional self-healing materials beyond
 infrastructure applications into active environmental remediation [43]. The concept of temporal memory,
 where materials learn from past environmental conditions and adjust accordingly, introduces a novel paradigm
 in smart materials [44]. Additionally, the hypothesis that interconnected materials could develop emergent,
 collective behavior akin to biological ecosystems presents an interesting perspective on material intelligence
 and sustainability [45, 46].
 Agentic Compositional Reasoning We can formalize this approach further and induce agentic strategy
 to develop compositional reasoning (see, Section 4.5.1 for details). In this experiment, implement a systematic
 development of hierarchical reasoning over concepts, pairs of concepts, and so on. The resulting document is
 shown in Supporting Text 2, and Figure 18 shows a flowchart of the reasoning process.
 24
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 Figure 18: Compositional framework applied to the longest shortest path. The flowchart illustrates the hierarchical
 process of compositional reasoning, beginning with atomic components (fundamental scientific concepts, left, as
 identified in the longest shortest path (Figure 17(a))) and progressing through pairwise fusions, bridge synergies,
 and a final expanded discovery. Each stage (Steps A, B, C and D) integrates concepts systematically, ensuring
 interoperability, generativity, and hierarchical refinement, culminating in the EcoCycle framework for sustainable
 infrastructure development.
 The example ultimately presents a structured approach to compositional scientific discovery, integrating
 principles from infrastructure materials science, environmental sustainability, and artificial intelligence to
 develop a novel framework for sustainable infrastructure, termed EcoCycle. As can be seen in Supporting
 Text 2 and in Figure 18, the compositional reasoning process proceeded through multiple hierarchical steps,
 ensuring the systematic combination of concepts with well-defined relationships.
 At the foundational level, atomic components were identified, each representing an independent domain concept,
 such as biodegradable microplastic materials, self-healing materials, predictive modeling, and knowledge
 25
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 discovery. These fundamental elements were then combined into pairwise fusions, leveraging shared properties
 to generate novel synergies. For instance, the fusion of self-healing materials with pollution mitigation
 led to environmental self-healing systems, integrating autonomous repair mechanisms with pollution
 reduction strategies. Similarly, combining impact-resistant materials with machine learning algorithms
 enabled damage forecasting systems, enhancing predictive maintenance in infrastructure.
 The validity of this compositional reasoning was established by ensuring that each fusion preserved the
 integrity of its constituent concepts while generating emergent functionalities. The process adhered to
 key compositionality principles: (1) Interoperability, ensuring that combined components interacted
 meaningfully rather than arbitrarily; (2) Generativity, whereby new properties emerged that were not
 present in the individual components; and (3) Hierarchical Refinement, wherein smaller-scale synergies
 were recursively integrated into higher-order bridge synergies. This led to overarching themes such as the
 intersection of environmental sustainability and technological innovation and the holistic
 understanding of complex systems, demonstrating the robustness of the approach.
 Ultimately, these synergies converged into the EcoCycle framework, encapsulating self-healing, eco-responsive,
 and AI-optimized infrastructure solutions. The structured composition ensured that emergent discoveries
 were not mere aggregations but cohesive, context-aware innovations, validating the methodological rigor of
 the compositional approach. Using a strategy of adhering to systematic composition principles, the method
 used here demonstrates how interdisciplinary insights can be synthesized into scientific concepts.
 For comparison, Supporting Text 3 shows the same experiment but where we use o1-pro in the final step of
 synthesis.
 Putting this into context, earlier work [47, 48, 49, 50] have highlighted significant limitations in large language
 models (LLMs) concerning their ability to perform systematic compositional reasoning, particularly in
 domains requiring logical integration and generalization. Our approach directly addresses these deficiencies
 by structuring reasoning processes in a progressive and interpretable manner. Despite possessing individual
 components of knowledge, LLMs often struggle to integrate these dynamically to detect inconsistencies or
 solve problems requiring novel reasoning paths. We mitigate this by explicitly encoding relationships between
 concepts within a graph structure. Unlike conventional LLMs that rely on associative pattern recognition
 or statistical co-occurrence [47], our structured approach mitigates the concerns of mere connectionist
 representations by enforcing rule-based, interpretable generalization mechanisms that allow for dynamic
 recombination of learned knowledge in novel contexts. Further, our approach ensures that each reasoning step
 builds upon prior knowledge in a structured hierarchy. Steps A-D in our framework progressively construct
 solutions by leveraging explicit connections between concepts, enforcing compositionality rather than assuming
 it. For example, our approach connects biodegradable microplastic materials with self-healing materials, not
 merely through surface-level similarities but through defined mechanisms such as thermoreversible gelation
 and environmental interactions. Instead of expecting an LLM to infer relationships in a single step, our
 agentic model progressively traverses reasoning graphs, ensuring that the final outcome emerges through
 logically justified intermediary steps. This not only reduces reliance on pattern memorization but also
 enhances interpretability and robustness in novel scenarios.
 Our model further enhances compositional reasoning through three key mechanisms:
 1. Explicit Pathway Construction: By mapping dependencies between concepts in a structured
 graph, our model ensures that each step in the reasoning process is explicitly defined and logically
 connected.
 2. Adaptive Contextual Integration: Instead of treating reasoning steps as isolated tasks, the
 model dynamically integrates intermediate results to refine its conclusions, ensuring that errors or
 inconsistencies in earlier stages are corrected before final predictions.
 3. Hierarchical Synergy Identification: Our model analyzes multi-domain interactions through
 graph traversal and thereby identify emergent patterns that standard LLMs would overlook, enabling
 more robust and flexible reasoning. These mechanisms collectively establish a reasoning framework
 that mitigates compositional deficiencies and facilitates the structured synthesis of knowledge.
 Table 2 summarizes how our approach directly addresses key LLM limitations identified in earlier work.
 Further analysis of these is left to future work, as they would exceed the scope of the present paper. The
 experiments show that principled approaches to expand knowledge can indeed be implemented using the
 methodologies described above, complementing other recent work that has explored related topics [29, 49, 23,
 50, 47].

 Table 2: Comparison of limitations of conventional LLMs, and our approach addresses these. By explicitly structuring
 relationships between concepts, breaking down reasoning into progressive steps, and incorporating dynamic knowledge
 recombination, our approach achieves a higher level of structured compositionality that conventional LLMs struggle
 with. Future work could further refine this approach by introducing adaptive feedback loops, reinforcing causal
 reasoning, and incorporating quantitative constraints to strengthen knowledge synergies.
 2.13 Utilization of Graph Reasoning over Key Hubs and Influencer Nodes in Response
 Generation
 In this example, we analyze the knowledge graph G2 using NetworkX to compute node centralities (betweenness
 and eigenvector centrality), identifying key hubs and influencers. Community detection via the Louvain
 method partitions the graph into conceptual clusters, extracting representative nodes per community.
 Key relationships are identified by examining high-centrality nodes and their strongest edges. These insights
 are formatted into a structured context and integrated into a task-specific prompt for LLM reasoning on
 impact-resistant materials, the same prompt that was used to construct the original graph.
 The model’s response is generated both with and without graph data, followed by a comparative evaluation
 based on graph utilization, depth of reasoning, scientific rigor, and innovativeness. Raw responses for both
 models are shown in Text Boxes S1 and S2. Table S1 provides a detailed comparison, and Figure 19 compares
 responses based on four key evaluation metrics (Graph Utilization, Depth of Reasoning, Scientific Rigor, and
 Innovativeness, along with the overall score).
 2.14 Use of an Agentic Deep Reasoning Model to Generate new Hypotheses and Anticipated
 Material Behavior
 Next, we use the SciAgents model [51] with the o3-mini reasoning model [52] as the back-end, and graph G2to
 answer this question: Create a research idea around impact resistant materials and resilience.
 Rate the novelty and feasibility in the end.
 The path-finding algorithm that integrates node embeddings and a degree of randomness to enhance exploration
 sampling strategy [51] extracts this sub-graph from the larger graph:
 Impact Resistant Materials-- IS-A-- Materials-- IS-A-- Impact-Resistant Materials-- INFLUENCES-- Modular Infrastructure

RELATES-TO-- Smart Infrastructure-- RELATES-TO-- Impact-Resistant Materials-- RELATES-TO-- Machine Learning Algorithms-
RELATES-TO-- Impact-Resistant Materials-- RELATES-TO-- Resilience
 As described in [51] paths are sampled using a path-finding algorithm that utilizes both node embeddings and
 a degree of randomness to enhance exploration as a path is identified between distinct concepts. Critically,
 instead of simply identifying the shortest path, the algorithm introduces stochastic elements by selecting
 waypoints and modifying priority queues in a modified version of Dijkstra’s algorithm. This allows for
 the discovery of richer and more diverse paths in a knowledge graph. The resulting paths serve as the
 foundation for graph-based reasoning specifically geared towards research hypothesis generation, ensuring a
 more extensive and insightful exploration of scientific concepts.
 Visualizations of the subgraph are shown in Figure 20, depicting the subgraph alone (Figure 20(a)) and the
 subgraph with second hops (Figure 20(b), showing the deep interconnectness that can be extracted).

Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 Figure 19: Comparison of Responses on Impact-Resistant Material Design. This plot compares two responses based
 on four key evaluation metrics: Graph Utilization, Depth of Reasoning, Scientific Rigor, and Innovativeness, along
 with the overall score. Response 1, which incorporates graph-based insights, AI/ML techniques, and interdisciplinary
 approaches, outperforms Response 2 in all categories. Response 2 follows a more conventional materials science
 approach without leveraging computational methods. The higher overall score of Response 1 highlights the benefits of
 integrating advanced data-driven methodologies in material design.
 The resulting document Supporting Text 4 presents the results of applying SciAgents to G2 in the context
 of impact-resistant materials and infrastructure resilience. The graph representation serves as a structured
 framework for reasoning about the relationships between key concepts—impact-resistant materials, self-healing
 mechanisms, machine learning optimization, and modular infrastructure—by encoding dependencies and
 influences between them. Graph 2 specifically captures these interconnected domains as nodes, with edges
 representing logical or causal links, enabling a systematic exploration of pathways that lead to optimal
 material design strategies. The path traversal within the graph identifies key dependencies, such as how
 impact-resistant materials influence infrastructure resilience or how machine learning refines self-healing
 efficiency. This structured pathway-based reasoning allows SciAgents to generate research hypotheses that
 maximize cross-domain synergies, ensuring that material properties are not optimized in isolation but rather
 in concert with their broader applications in engineering and sustainability. Furthermore, graph traversal
 reveals emergent relationships—such as how integrating real-time sensor feedback into modular infrastructure
 could create self-improving materials—that might not be immediately evident through conventional linear
 analysis. Thus, the use of graph-based reasoning is pivotal in formulating a research framework that is not
 only interdisciplinary but also systematically optimized for long-term infrastructure resilience and material
 adaptability.
 In terms of specific content, the proposed research explores an advanced composite material that integrates
 carbon nanotube (CNT)-reinforced polymer matrices with self-healing microcapsules, embedded sensor
 networks, and closed-loop ML optimization. The goal is to create a dynamically self-improving material
 system that enhances impact resistance and longevity in modular infrastructure. The material design is
 structured around several key components: (1) CNT reinforcement (1–2 wt%) to improve tensile strength
 and fracture toughness, (2) self-healing microcapsules (50–200 µm) filled with polymerizable agents, (3)
 embedded graphene-based or PVDF strain sensors for real-time monitoring, and (4) adaptive ML algorithms
 that regulate stress distributions and healing responses.
 The proposal establishes interconnections between several domains, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature
 of the research: impact-resistant materials are a subset of general materials with enhanced energy dissipation

 key nodes acting as central hubs in the reasoning framework. The right panel (b) represents an expanded subgraph
 that includes second-hop neighbors. Nodes from the original subgraph are colored orange, while newly introduced
 second-hop nodes are green. The increased connectivity and density indicate the broader network relationships
 captured through second-hop expansion. Larger orange nodes remain dominant in connectivity, while green nodes
 form supporting structures, emphasizing peripheral interactions and their contribution to knowledge propagation.

 information, enriching the overall structure..
 properties, modular infrastructure benefits from these materials due to increased durability, self-healing
 materials reduce maintenance cycles, and machine learning optimizes real-time responses to structural stress.
 This holistic framework aims to advance infrastructure resilience and sustainability. The research hypothesizes
 that embedding self-healing microcapsules within a CNT-reinforced polymer matrix will yield a composite
 with superior impact resistance and adaptive repair capabilities. Expected performance gains include a 50%
 increase in impact energy absorption (surpassing 200 J/m²), up to 80% recovery of mechanical properties
 after micro-damage, an estimated 30% improvement in yield strain, a 50% extension in structural lifetime,
 and a 30% reduction in required maintenance interventions.
 The composite operates via a multi-scale integration strategy where nanoscale CNTs form a stress-bridging
 network, microscale healing agents autonomously restore structural integrity, and macroscale sensors collect
 real-time strain data to inform machine learning-based optimizations. The closed-loop ML system refines
 material responses dynamically, preemptively addressing stress concentrations before catastrophic failure
 occurs. This iterative self-optimization process is represented in the flowchart shown in Figure 21.
 Compared to conventional high-performance composites such as ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene
 (UHMWPE) and standard carbon fiber-reinforced polymers, the proposed material demonstrates superior
 mechanical performance and autonomous damage remediation. Traditional impact-resistant materials typically
 absorb 120–150 J/m² of energy, whereas this system is designed to exceed 200 J/m². Additionally, existing
 self-healing materials recover only 50–60% of their mechanical properties, while this composite targets an 80%
 restoration rate. The modular design ensures seamless integration into existing infrastructure, supporting
 scalability and standardization.
 Beyond its core functions, the composite exhibits several emergent properties: (1) localized reinforcement
 zones where healing chemistry alters stress distributions, (2) increased energy dissipation efficiency over
 repeated impact cycles, (3) long-term self-improving feedback where ML-driven adjustments refine material
 performance, and (4) potential microstructural evolution, such as crystalline phase formation, that enhances
 impact resistance. These unexpected yet beneficial attributes highlight the adaptive nature of the material
 system.

 Upon an impact event, embedded sensors (cyan) detect strain changes and transmit real-time data to a machine
 learning system (violet). This system predicts stress evolution and dynamically adjusts healing response thresholds
 (light violet). Microcapsules containing polymerizable agents (green) rupture at critical points, autonomously restoring
 material integrity. A feedback mechanism (yellow) continuously refines the process, ensuring adaptive optimization
 over multiple impact cycles. The dashed feedback loop signifies that each iteration improves the material’s ability to
 predict and mitigate future stress events, making the system progressively more efficient.
 The broader implications of this research include significant economic and environmental benefits. By
 reducing maintenance frequency by 30%, the composite lowers infrastructure downtime and lifecycle costs.
 The extended service life translates to a 25–30% reduction in resource consumption and associated carbon
 emissions. While the upfront processing cost is higher due to advanced material fabrication and sensor
 integration, the long-term cost per operational year is projected to be competitive with, or superior to,
 existing alternatives.
 This interdisciplinary fusion of nanomaterials, self-healing chemistry, real-time sensor feedback, and machine
 learning-based control represents a fundamental shift from passive materials to smart, self-optimizing
 systems. The proposed research not only addresses impact resistance and self-repair but also pioneers
 an adaptable, continuously improving infrastructure material. The combination of rigorous experimental
 validation (e.g., ASTM mechanical testing, finite element modeling, and real-world simulations) ensures that
 the material’s theoretical advantages translate into practical performance gains. This research positions
 itself as a transformative solution for infrastructure resilience, bridging the gap between static engineering
 materials and dynamically intelligent, self-regulating composites.
 3 Conclusion
 This work introduced a framework for recursive graph expansion, demonstrating that self-organizing
 intelligence-like behavior can emerge through iterative reasoning without predefined ontologies, external
 supervision, or centralized control. Unlike conventional knowledge graph expansion techniques that rely on
 static extractions, probabilistic link predictions, or reinforcement learning-based traversal, extensive test-time
 compute Graph-PReFLexOR graph reasoning actively restructures its own knowledge representation as it
 30
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 evolves, allowing for dynamic adaptation and autonomous knowledge synthesis. These findings are generally
 in line with other recent results that elucidated the importance of inference scaling methods [25, 52, 53, 26].
 Through extensive graph-theoretic analysis, we found that the recursively generated knowledge structures
 exhibit scale-free properties, hierarchical modularity, and sustained interdisciplinary connectivity, aligning
 with patterns observed in human knowledge systems. The formation of conceptual hubs (Figures 4-5) and the
 emergence of bridge nodes (Figures 12) demonstrate that the system autonomously organizes information into a
 structured yet flexible network, facilitating both local coherence and global knowledge integration. Importantly,
 the model does not appear to saturate or stagnate; instead, it continuously reorganizes relationships between
 concepts by reinforcing key conceptual linkages while allowing new hypotheses to emerge through iterative
 reasoning (Figures 11 and 14).
 One of the most striking findings is the self-regulation of knowledge propagation pathways. The early
 stages of graph expansion relied heavily on a few dominant nodes (high betweenness centrality), but over
 successive iterations, knowledge transfer became increasingly distributed and decentralized (Figure S3). This
 structural transformation suggests that recursive self-organization naturally reduces bottlenecks, enabling a
 more resilient and scalable knowledge framework. Additionally, we observed alternating phases of conceptual
 stability and breakthrough, indicating that knowledge formation follows a punctuated equilibrium model,
 rather than purely incremental accumulation.
 More broadly, the recursive self-organization process produces emergent, fractal-like knowledge structures,
 suggesting that similar principles may underlie both human cognition and the design of intelligent systems [42].
 Moreover, the potential role of bridge nodes—as connectors and as natural intervention points—is underscored
 by their persistent yet shifting influence, implying they could be strategically targeted for system updates
 or error correction in a self-organizing network. Additionally, the observed alternating phases of stable
 community formation punctuated by sudden breakthroughs appear to mirror the concept of punctuated
 equilibrium in scientific discovery [1], offering a promising framework for understanding the natural emergence
 of innovation. These insights extend the implications of our work beyond scientific discovery, hinting at
 broader applications in autonomous reasoning, such as adaptive natural language understanding and real-time
 decision-making in complex environments. We demonstrated a few initial use cases where we used graph
 structures in attempts towards compositional reasoning, as shown in Figure 18.
 3.1 Graph Evolution Dynamics: Interplay of Network Measures
 The evolution of the knowledge graph reveals a complex interplay between growth, connectivity, centralization,
 and structural reorganization, with different network-theoretic measures exhibiting distinct yet interdependent
 behaviors over iterations. Initially, the system undergoes rapid expansion, as seen in the near-linear increase
 in the number of nodes and edges (Figure 4). However, despite this outward growth, the clustering coefficient
 stabilizes early (around 0.16), suggesting that the graph maintains a balance between connectivity and
 modularity rather than devolving into isolated clusters. This stabilization indicates that the system does not
 expand chaotically but instead integrates new knowledge in a structured and preferentially attached manner,
 reinforcing key concepts while allowing for exploration.
 One of the most informative trends is the evolution of betweenness centrality (Figure 16), which starts highly
 concentrated in a few key nodes but then redistributes over time, reflecting a transition from hub-dominated
 information flow to a more decentralized and resilient network. This shift aligns with the gradual stabilization
 of average shortest path length (around 4.5, see Figure 9) and the graph diameter (around 16–18 steps, see
 Figure 5), implying that while knowledge expands, it remains navigable and does not suffer from excessive
 fragmentation. Meanwhile, the maximum k-core index (Figure 6) exhibits a stepwise increase, reflecting
 structured phases of densification where core knowledge regions consolidate before expanding further. This
 suggests that the system undergoes punctuated reorganization, where newly introduced concepts occasionally
 necessitate internal restructuring before further outward growth.
 Interestingly, the degree assortativity starts strongly negative (around-0.25) and trends toward neutrality
 (-0.05), indicating that high-degree nodes initially dominate connections but later distribute their influence,
 allowing mid-degree nodes to contribute to network connectivity. This effect is reinforced by the persistence
 of bridge nodes (Figures 6-16), where we see a long-tail distribution of interdisciplinary connectors—some
 nodes serve as transient links that appear briefly, while others persist across hundreds of iterations, indicating
 stable, high-impact conceptual connectors.
 Taken together, these experimentally observed trends suggest that the system self-regulates its expansion,
 dynamically shifting between growth, consolidation, and reorganization phases. The absence of saturation
 31
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 in key structural properties (such as new edge formation and bridge node emergence) indicates that the
 model supports continuous knowledge discovery, rather than converging to a fixed-state representation.
 This emergent behavior, where network-wide connectivity stabilizes while conceptual expansion remains
 open-ended, suggests that recursive graph reasoning could serve as a scalable foundation for autonomous
 scientific exploration, adaptive learning, and self-organizing knowledge systems.
 3.2 Relevance in the Context of Materials Science
 The framework introduced in this work offers a novel paradigm for accelerating discovery in materials
 science by systematically structuring and expanding knowledge networks. Unlike traditional approaches
 that rely on static databases or predefined ontologies [54, 55, 56, 57, 58], our self-organizing method enables
 dynamic hypothesis generation, uncovering hidden relationships between material properties, synthesis
 pathways, and functional behaviors. The emergent scale-free networks observed in our experiments reflect
 the underlying modularity and hierarchical organization often seen in biological and engineered materials,
 suggesting that recursive graph-based reasoning could serve as a computational analogue to self-assembling
 and adaptive materials. Applied to materials design, the approach developed in this paper could reveal
 unexpected synergies between molecular architectures and macroscale performance, leading to new pathways
 for bioinspired, multifunctional, and self-healing materials. Future work can integrate experimental data
 directly into these reasoning loops, allowing AI-driven materials discovery to move beyond retrieval-focused
 recognition toward novel inference and innovation. We believe it is essential to bridge the gap between
 autonomous reasoning and materials informatics to ultimately create self-improving knowledge systems that
 can adaptively guide materials engineering efforts in real-time [59].
 3.3 Broader Implications
 The observations put forth in this paper have potential implications for AI-driven scientific reasoning,
 autonomous hypothesis generation, and scientific inquiry. As our results demonstrate, complex knowledge
 structures can self-organize without explicit goal-setting. This work challenges a prevailing assumption
 that intelligence requires externally imposed constraints or supervision. Instead, it suggests that intelligent
 reasoning may emerge as a fundamental property of recursive, feedback-driven information processing,
 mirroring cognitive processes observed in scientific discovery and human learning. Our experiments that
 directed the evolution of the thinking mechanisms towards a certain goal were provided with relational
 modeling that incorporated these concepts in a more pronounced manner, as expected, provisioning a powerful
 substrate for deeper reasoning.
 Future work could potentially explore extending this framework to multi-agent reasoning environments,
 cross-domain knowledge synthesis, and real-world applications in AI-driven research discovery. Additionally,
 refining interpretability mechanisms will be crucial for ensuring that autonomously generated insights align
 with human epistemic standards, minimizing risks related to misinformation propagation and reasoning
 biases. Bridging graph-theoretic modeling, AI reasoning, and self-organizing knowledge dynamics, allowed us
 to provide a step toward building AI systems capable of autonomous, scalable, and transparent knowledge
 formation on their own.
 We note that wile our agentic deep graph reasoning framework demonstrates promise in achieving self
organizing knowledge formation, several challenges remain. In particular, the computational scalability of
 recursive graph expansions and the sensitivity of emergent structures to parameter choices warrant further
 investigation. Future work should explore robust error-correction strategies, enhanced interpretability of
 evolving networks, and ethical guidelines to ensure transparency in autonomous reasoning systems, especially
 if deployed in commercial or public settings beyond academic research. Addressing these issues will not only
 refine the current model but also paves the way for its application in real-world autonomous decision-making
 and adaptive learning environments.
 4 Materials and Methods
 We describe key materials and methods developed and used in the course of this study in this section.
 4.1 Graph-PReFLexOR model development
 A detailed account of the Graph-PReFLexOR is provided in [27]. Graph-PReFLexOR (Graph-based
 Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning) is an AI model
 32
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 integrating in-situ graph reasoning, symbolic abstraction, and recursive reflection into generative modeling.
 The model was trained on a set of around 1,000 scientific papers in the biological materials and bio-inspired
 materials domain, as discussed in [27]. We refer readers to the original paper for implementation details, but
 provide a high-level summary here. The method defines reasoning as a structured mapping:
 M:T →(G,P,A),
 (2)
 where a given task T generates a knowledge graph G = (V,E) with nodes V representing key concepts and
 edges E denoting relationships, abstract patterns P capturing structural dependencies, and final answers
 A. Inspired by category theory, the approach encodes knowledge through hierarchical inference, leveraging
 isomorphisms to generalize across domains. The model autonomously constructs symbolic representations
 via a reasoning phase marked by <|thinking|> ... <|/thinking|> tokens, refining understanding before
 generating outputs. Recursive optimization can further improve logical coherence, aligning responses with
 generalizable principles, a particular feature that will be expanded on in this paper.
 To enhance the adaptability of structured reasoning, Graph-PReFLexOR employs an iterative feedback
 mechanism:
 Ri+1 = feval(Ri,Fi),
 (3)
 where Ri denotes the intermediate reasoning at step i, Fi is the feedback applied to improve logical structure,
 and feval evaluates alignment with domain principles. The final answer A is derived after N refinements as:
 A=g(RN).
 (4)
 Through the idea to explicitly model knowledge graphs and symbolic representations, this method attempts
 to bridge connectionist and symbolic paradigms, facilitating multi-step reasoning, hypothesis generation, and
 interdisciplinary knowledge expansion. Empirical evaluations in [27] demonstrated its capability to generalize
 beyond training data. In this study, we take advantage of the capability of Graph-PReFLexOR to generate
 graph representations on the fly over a great number of iterations during which the model continues to expand
 its reasoning tokens.
 4.2 Iterative Unconstrained Graph Reasoning on General Topic
 We develop an iterative knowledge extraction pipeline to construct a structured knowledge graph using a
 LLM, following the flowchart shown in Figure 1. The method systematically expands a graph representation
 of relationships by extracting structured knowledge from model-generated reasoning sequences and generating
 follow-up queries to refine exploration. We use this method to construct G1.
 At the start of each run, the algorithm initializes an initial question or prompt. This can be very general or
 focus on a particular topic that defines the area of scientific inquiry. In the example, the topic is set as:
 prompt = "Discuss an interesting idea in bio-inspired materials science."
 The LLM then generates structured reasoning responses within the <|thinking|> ... <|/thinking|> tokens.
 The response is processed to extract structured knowledge by isolating the graph.
 To convert the extracted knowledge into a structured representation, the model is queried with an additional
 instruction to transform the resulting raw text that contains the reasoning graph (denoted by {raw graph})
 into a Python dictionary formatted for graph representation:
 You are an AI that extracts information from structured text and outputs a graph in Python dictionary format compatible with
 NetworkX.
 Given the following structured text:
 {raw
 graph}
 for immediate evaluation in Python.
 Output the graph as a Python dictionary without any additional text or explanations. Ensure the dictionary is properly formatted
 The output is parsed and structured using ast.literal_eval() to construct a directed graph Gi
 local in
 NetworkX, where nodes represent entities such as materials, properties, and scientific concepts, while edges
 encode relationships such as HAS, INFLUENCES, and SIMILAR-TO.
 At each iteration i, the newly extracted knowledge graph is appended to an evolving global graph:
 G ←G∪Gi

 The extracted structure is parsed using:

Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 graph_code, graph_dict = extract_graph_from_text(graph)
 The graph is progressively expanded by adding newly introduced nodes and edges, ensuring that redundant
 relationships are not duplicated. The final knowledge graph is stored in multiple formats, including GraphML
 for structural analysis and PNG for visualization.
 To facilitate continued exploration, a follow-up question is generated at each iteration. The LLM is queried
 to produce a question that introduces a new aspect of the domain, ensuring an iterative, self-refining process
 that utilizes the previously generated entities and relations:
 Consider this list of topics/keywords. Formulate a creative follow-up question to ask about a totally new concept.
 Your question should include at least one of the original topics/keywords.
 Original list of topics/keywords:
 {lat

 ties
 andrela
 tions}
 Reply only with the new question. The new question is:
 This ensures that subsequent queries remain contextually grounded in the domain while promoting scientific
 discovery. The generated question is appended to the reasoning token structure and fed back into the LLM,
 thereby continuing the iterative learning process.
 The algorithm runs for a total of N iterations, progressively refining the knowledge graph. At each step, we
 track the growth of the graph by recording the number of nodes and edges over time. The final knowledge
 graph provides a structured and extensible representation of insights extracted from the LLM, enabling
 downstream analysis of emerging concepts. The reasoning process (Figure 1) unfolds sequentially over a
 period of several days (using a consumer GPU, like NVIDIA A6000 Ada).
 4.3 Iterative Graph Reasoning on a Particular Topic
 As an alternative to the approach above, we can tailor the reasoning process to focus more strongly on
 a particular topic. We use this method to construct G2. For instance, at the beginning of each run, the
 algorithm is initialized with a user-defined topic:
 topic = "impact resistant materials"
 This variable defines the area of exploration and is dynamically incorporated into the model prompts. The
 LLM is then queried with a topic-conditioned instruction to generate structured reasoning tokens:
 Describe a way to design
 {topic}.
 The model generates textual responses that include explicit reasoning within the <|thinking|> ... <|/think
ing|> markers. As before, from this output, we extract structured knowledge by isolating the section labeled
 graph, to extract entity-relationship pairs. A follow-up question is generated at each iteration to drive the
 discovery process forward. This prompt ensures that new queries focus on underexplored aspects of the
 knowledge graph while maintaining the topic-conditioned structure:
 Consider this list of keywords. Considering the broad topic of
 {topic}, formulate a creative follow-up question to ask about a
 totally new aspect. Your question should include at least one of the original keywords.
 Original list of keywords:
 {lat

 andrela
 tions}
 Reply only with the new question. The new question is:
 This ensures that each iteration remains contextually grounded in the specified domain while continuously
 expanding the knowledge graph.
 The process continues for N steps, progressively refining the knowledge graph. At each iteration, we track
 the growth of the graph by recording the number of nodes and edges. The resulting knowledge graph serves
 as a structured repository of insights extracted from the LLM, enabling downstream analysis of materials
 properties and design principles.
 Naturally, other variants of these strategies could easily be devised, for instance to create other generalist
 graphs (akin to G1) or specialized graphs (akin to G2). Prompt engineering can be human-tailored or developed
 agentically by other AI systems.

 4.4 Graph Analysis and Visualization
 Graph analysis and visualizations are conducted using NetworkX [60], Gephi [61], Cytoscope [62], Mer
maid https://mermaid.js.org/, and various plugins within these packages.
 4.4.1 Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth over Reasoning Iterations
 To analyze the recursive expansion of the knowledge graph, we computed a set of graph-theoretic properties
 at each iteration using the NetworkX Python library. Graph data was stored in GraphML format, with
 f
 ilenames encoded to reflect the iteration number, allowing for chronological tracking of structural changes.
 Each graph was sequentially loaded and processed to extract key metrics that characterize its connectivity,
 topology, and hierarchical organization.
 The fundamental properties of the graph, including the number of nodes and edges, were directly retrieved
 from the graph structure. The degree distribution was computed across all nodes to derive the average degree,
 representing the mean connectivity per node, and the maximum degree, which highlights the most connected
 node at each iteration. To assess network cohesion, the largest connected component (LCC) was extracted by
 identifying the largest strongly connected component in directed graphs and the largest connected subgraph
 in undirected cases. The clustering coefficient was computed using the standard local clustering metric, which
 quantifies the likelihood that a node’s neighbors are also connected to each other. The average clustering
 coefficient was obtained by averaging over all nodes in the graph, providing insight into the tendency of local
 structures to form tightly connected clusters.
 To assess global connectivity and efficiency, we computed the average shortest path length (SPL) and the
 graph diameter within the largest connected component. The SPL was obtained by calculating the mean
 shortest path distance between all pairs of nodes in the LCC, while the diameter was determined as the
 longest shortest path observed in the component. Since these calculations are computationally expensive
 for large graphs, they were conditionally executed only when the LCC was sufficiently small or explicitly
 enabled in the analysis. For community detection, we applied the Louvain modularity algorithm using the
 community-louvain package. The graph was treated as undirected for this step, and the modularity score
 was computed by partitioning the graph into communities that maximize the modularity function. This
 metric captures the extent to which the graph naturally organizes into distinct clusters over iterations.
 The entire analysis pipeline iterated over a series of GraphML files, extracting the iteration number from
 each filename and systematically computing these metrics. The results were stored as time series arrays
 and visualized through multi-panel plots, capturing trends in network evolution. To optimize performance,
 computationally intensive operations, such as shortest path calculations and modularity detection, were
 executed conditionally based on graph size and software availability. To further examine the structural
 evolution of the recursively generated knowledge graph, we computed a set of advanced graph-theoretic
 metrics over iterative expansions. As before, the analysis was conducted over a series of iterations, allowing
 for the study of emergent network behaviors.
 The degree assortativity coefficient was computed to measure the correlation between node degrees, assessing
 whether high-degree nodes preferentially connect to similar nodes. This metric provides insight into the
 network’s structural organization and whether its expansion follows a preferential attachment mechanism.
 The global transitivity, defined as the fraction of closed triplets among all possible triplets, was calculated
 to quantify the overall clustering tendency of the graph and detect the emergence of tightly interconnected
 regions. To assess the hierarchical connectivity structure, we performed k-core decomposition, which identifies
 the maximal subgraph where all nodes have at least k neighbors. We extracted the maximum k-core index,
 representing the deepest level of connectivity within the network, and computed the size of the largest k-core,
 indicating the robustness of highly connected core regions.
 For understanding the importance of individual nodes in information flow, we computed average betweenness
 centrality over the largest connected component. Betweenness centrality quantifies the extent to which nodes
 serve as intermediaries in shortest paths, highlighting critical nodes that facilitate efficient navigation of
 the knowledge graph. Since exact computation of betweenness centrality can be computationally expensive
 for large graphs, it was performed only within the largest component to ensure feasibility. Additionally, we
 identified articulation points, which are nodes whose removal increases the number of connected components in
 the network. The presence and distribution of articulation points reveal structural vulnerabilities, highlighting
 nodes that serve as key bridges between different knowledge regions.

 4.4.2 Prediction of Newly Connected Pairs
 To track the evolution of connectivity in the recursively expanding knowledge graph, we employed a random
 sampling approach to estimate the number of newly connected node pairs at each iteration. Given the
 computational cost of computing all-pairs shortest paths in large graphs, we instead sampled a fixed number
 of node pairs per iteration and measured changes in their shortest path distances over time.
 Sampling Strategy. At each iteration, we randomly selected 1,000 node pairs from the current set of nodes
 in the global knowledge graph. For each sampled pair (u,v), we computed the shortest path length in the
 graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS), implemented via nx.single_source_shortest_path_length(G,
 src). If a path existed, its length was recorded; otherwise, it was marked as unreachable.
 Tracking Newly Connected Pairs. To detect the formation of new connections, we maintained a record
 of shortest path distances from the previous iteration and compared them with the current distances. A pair
 (u, v) was classified as:
 • Newly connected if it was previously unreachable (distbefore = None) but became connected
 (distnow= None).
 • Having a shorter path if its shortest path length decreased between iterations (distnow < distbefore).
 The number of newly connected pairs and the number of pairs with shortened paths were recorded for each
 iteration.
 Graph Integration and Visualization. At each iteration, the newly processed graph was merged
 into a global knowledge graph, ensuring cumulative analysis over time. The number of newly connected
 pairs per iteration was plotted as a time series, revealing patterns in connectivity evolution. This method
 effectively captures structural transitions, particularly the initial burst of connectivity formation followed by
 a steady-state expansion phase, as observed in the results.
 By employing this approach, we achieved a computationally efficient yet statistically robust estimate of
 network connectivity evolution, allowing us to analyze the self-organizing dynamics of the reasoning process
 over large iterative expansions.
 4.4.3 Graph Structure and Community Analysis
 To examine the structural properties of the recursively generated knowledge graph, we performed a compre
hensive analysis of node connectivity, degree distribution, clustering behavior, shortest-path efficiency, and
 community structure. The graph was loaded from a GraphML file using the NetworkX library, and various
 metrics were computed to assess both local and global network properties.
 Basic Graph Properties. The fundamental characteristics of the graph, including the number of nodes,
 edges, and average degree, were extracted. Additionally, the number of self-loops was recorded to identify
 redundant connections that may influence network dynamics.
 Graph Component Analysis. To ensure robust connectivity analysis, the largest connected component
 (LCC) was extracted for undirected graphs, while the largest strongly connected component (SCC) was used
 for directed graphs. This ensured that further structural computations were performed on a fully connected
 subgraph, avoiding artifacts from disconnected nodes.
 Degree Distribution Analysis. The degree distribution was computed and visualized using both a
 linear-scale histogram and a log-log scatter plot. The latter was used to assess whether the network exhibits
 a power-law degree distribution, characteristic of scale-free networks.
 Clustering Coefficient Analysis. The local clustering coefficient, which quantifies the tendency of nodes
 to form tightly connected triads, was computed for each node. The distribution of clustering coefficients was
 plotted, and the average clustering coefficient was recorded to evaluate the extent of modular organization
 within the network.
 Centrality Measures. Three centrality metrics were computed to identify influential nodes: (i) Betweenness
 centrality, which measures the extent to which nodes act as intermediaries in shortest paths, highlighting key
 connectors in the knowledge graph; (ii) Closeness centrality, which quantifies the efficiency of information
 propagation from a given node; (iii) Eigenvector centrality, which identifies nodes that are highly influential
 due to their connections to other high-importance nodes.
 36
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 Shortest Path Analysis. The average shortest path length (SPL) and graph diameter were computed to
 evaluate the network’s navigability. Additionally, a histogram of sampled shortest path lengths was generated
 to analyze the distribution of distances between randomly selected node pairs (2,000 samples used).
 Community Detection and Modularity. The Louvain modularity algorithm was applied (if available)
 to partition the network into communities and assess its hierarchical structure. The modularity score was
 computed to quantify the strength of the detected community structure, and the resulting partitions were
 visualized using a force-directed layout.
 4.4.4 Analysis of Conceptual Breakthroughs
 The evolution of knowledge graphs is analyzed by processing a sequence of graph snapshots stored in
 GraphML format. Each graph is indexed by an iteration number, extracted using a regular expression from
 f
 ilenames of the form graph_iteration_#.graphml. The graphs are sequentially loaded and processed
 to ensure consistency across iterations. If the graph is directed, it is converted to an undirected format
 using the networkx.to_undirected() function. To ensure structural integrity, we extract the largest
 connected component using the networkx.connected_components() function, selecting the subgraph with
 the maximum number of nodes.
 For each iteration t, we compute the degree distribution of all nodes in the largest connected component.
 The degree of a node v in graph Gt = (Vt,Et) is given by:
 dt(v) =
 At(v,u)
 u∈Vt
 (6)
 where At is the adjacency matrix of Gt. The computed degree distributions are stored in a dictionary and
 later aggregated into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
 To track the emergence of top hubs, we define a node v as a hub if it attains a high degree at any iteration. The
 set of top hubs is determined by selecting the nodes with the highest maximum degree across all iterations:
 H ={v|max
 dt(v) ≥ dtop,10}
 t
 where dtop,10 is the degree of the 10th highest-ranked node in terms of maximum degree. The degree growth
 trajectory of each hub is then extracted by recording dt(v) for all t where v ∈ Vt.
 To quantify the emergence of new hubs, we define an emergence threshold demerge = 5, considering a node as
 a hub when its degree first surpasses this threshold. The first significant appearance of a node v is computed
 as:
 temerge(v) = min{t | dt(v) > demerge}
 for all v where such t exists. The histogram of temerge(v) across all nodes provides a temporal distribution of
 hub emergence.
 To evaluate global network connectivity, we compute the mean degree at each iteration:
 ¯
 dt = 1
 |Vt| v∈Vt 
dt(v)
 capturing the overall trend in node connectivity as the knowledge graph evolves.
 (7)
 Three key visualizations are generated: (1) the degree growth trajectories of top hubs, plotted as dt(v) over
 time for v ∈ H; (2) the emergence of new hubs, represented as a histogram of temerge(v); and (3) the overall
 network connectivity, visualized as ¯
 dt over iterations.
 4.4.5 Structural Evolution of the Graphs: Knowledge Communities, Bridge Nodes and
 Multi-hop Reasoning
 We analyze the structural evolution of knowledge graphs by computing three key metrics: (1) the number
 of distinct knowledge communities over time, (2) the emergence of bridge nodes that connect different
 knowledge domains, and (3) the depth of multi-hop reasoning based on shortest path lengths. These metrics
 are computed for each iteration t of the evolving graph and visualized as follows.
 The evolution of knowledge communities is measured using the Louvain modularity optimization algorithm,
 implemented via community.best_partition(), which partitions the graph into distinct communities. For
 each iteration, the number of detected communities |Ct| is computed as:
 |Ct| = |{c | c = Pt(v),v ∈ Vt}|
 37
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 where Pt(v) maps node v to its assigned community at iteration t. The values of |Ct| are plotted over
 iterations to track the subdivision and merging of knowledge domains over time.
 The emergence of bridge nodes, nodes that connect multiple communities, is determined by examining the
 community affiliations of each node’s neighbors. A node v is classified as a bridge node if:
 |C(v)| > 1, where C(v) = {Pt(u) | u ∈ N(v)}
 and N(v) represents the set of neighbors of v. The number of bridge nodes is computed per iteration and
 plotted to analyze how interdisciplinary connections emerge over time.
 The depth of multi-hop reasoning is quantified by computing the average shortest path length for the largest
 connected component at each iteration:
 Lt =
 1
 |Vt|(|Vt| − 1) v,u∈Vt,v=u
 dsp(v,u)
 where dsp(v,u) is the shortest path distance between nodes v and u, computed using net
workx.average_shortest_path_length(). This metric captures the evolving complexity of conceptual
 reasoning chains in the knowledge graph.
 We generate three plots: (1) the evolution of knowledge communities, visualizing |Ct| over time; (2) the
 emergence of bridge nodes, displaying the number of inter-community connectors per iteration; and (3) the
 depth of multi-hop reasoning, tracking Lt as a function of iteration number.
 To analyze the temporal stability of bridge nodes in the evolving knowledge graph, we compute the persistence
 of bridge nodes, which quantifies how long individual nodes function as bridges across multiple iterations.
 Given the bridge node set Bt at iteration t, the persistence count for a node v is defined as:
 P(v) =
 1(v ∈ Bt)
 t
 where 1(·) is the indicator function that equals 1 if v appears as a bridge node at iteration t, and 0 otherwise.
 This metric captures the frequency with which each node serves as a conceptual connector between different
 knowledge domains.
 To visualize the distribution of bridge node persistence, we construct a histogram of P(v) across all detected
 bridge nodes, with kernel density estimation (KDE) applied for smoother visualization. The histogram
 provides insight into whether bridge nodes are transient or persist over multiple iterations.
 The persistence values are computed and stored in a structured dataset, which is then used to generate a plot
 of the histogram of bridge node persistence.
 To analyze the temporal dynamics of bridge node emergence, we construct a binary presence matrix that
 tracks when individual nodes first appear as bridges. The matrix is used to visualize the earliest bridge nodes
 over time, capturing the structural formation of key conceptual connectors.
 The binary presence matrix is defined as follows. Given a set of bridge node lists Bt for each iteration t, we
 construct a matrix M where each row corresponds to an iteration and each column corresponds to a unique
 bridge node. The matrix entries are:
 Mt,v = 1, v∈Bt
 0, otherwise
 where Mt,v indicates whether node v appears as a bridge at iteration t. The full set of unique bridge nodes
 across all iterations is extracted to define the columns of M.
 To identify the earliest appearing bridge nodes we compute the first iteration in which each node appears:
 tfirst(v) = min{t | Mt,v = 1}
 The top 100 earliest appearing bridge nodes are selected by ranking nodes based on tfirst(v), keeping those
 with the smallest values. The binary matrix is then restricted to these nodes.
 To capture early-stage network formation, the analysis is limited to the first 200 iterations, ensuring that
 the onset of key bridge nodes is clearly visible. The final presence matrix M′ is reordered so that nodes are
 sorted by their first appearance, emphasizing the sequential nature of bridge formation.
 38
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 The matrix is visualized as a heatmap (Figure 13), where rows correspond to the top 100 earliest appearing
 bridge nodes and columns represent iterations. A blue-scale colormap is used to indicate presence (darker
 shades for active nodes).
 To analyze the evolution of key bridge nodes in the knowledge graph, we compute and track the betweenness
 centrality of all nodes across multiple iterations. Betweenness centrality quantifies the importance of a node
 as an intermediary in shortest paths and is defined as:
 CB(v) =
 s=v=t
 σst(v)
 σst
 where σst is the total number of shortest paths between nodes s and t, and σst(v) is the number of those
 paths that pass through v. This measure is recalculated at each iteration to observe structural changes in the
 network.
 The computational procedure is as follows:
 1. Graph Loading: Graph snapshots are loaded from GraphML files, indexed by iteration number. If
 a graph is directed, it is converted to an undirected format using networkx.to_undirected() to
 ensure consistent betweenness computations.
 2. Betweenness Centrality Calculation: For each graph Gt at iteration t, the betweenness centrality for
 all nodes is computed using networkx.betweenness_centrality().
 3. Time Series Construction: The computed centrality values are stored in a time-series matrix B,
 where rows correspond to iterations and columns correspond to nodes:
 Bt,v = CB(v) ∀v ∈ Vt
 Missing values (nodes absent in certain iterations) are set to zero to maintain a consistent matrix
 structure.
 To identify key bridge nodes, we extract the top ten nodes with the highest peak betweenness at any iteration:
 H ={v|max
 t
 Bt,v ≥ Btop,10}
 where Btop,10 represents the 10th highest betweenness value recorded across all iterations. The time-series
 data is filtered to retain only these nodes.
 To visualize the dynamic role of key bridge nodes, we generate a line plot of betweenness centrality evolution
 where each curve represents the changing centrality of a top bridge node over iterations. This graph captures
 how structural importance fluctuates over time.
 4.5 Agentic Approach to Reason over Longest Shortest Paths
 We employ an agentic approach to analyze structured knowledge representations in the form of a graph
 G=(V,E), where V represents the set of nodes (concepts) and E represents the set of edges (relationships).
 The methodology consists of four primary steps: (i) extraction of the longest knowledge path, (ii) decentralized
 node and relationship reasoning, (iii) multi-agent synthesis, and (iv) structured report generation.
 Path Extraction. The input knowledge graph G is first converted into an undirected graph G′ = (V,E′)
 where E′ contains bidirectional edges to ensure reachability across all nodes. We extract the largest connected
 component Gc by computing:
 Gc =arg max
 S∈C(G′)
 |S|
 where C(G′) is the set of all connected components in G′. The longest shortest path, or diameter path, is
 determined by computing the eccentricity:
 ϵ(v) = max
 u∈V 
d(v,u),
 where d(v,u) is the shortest path length between nodes v and u. The source node is selected as v∗ =
 argmaxv∈V ϵ(v), and the farthest reachable node from v∗ determines the longest path.
 Numerically, the longest paths are determined by computing node eccentricities using net
workx.eccentricity(), which identifies the most distant node pairs in terms of shortest paths. The
 39
Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning
 f
 ive longest shortest paths are extracted with networkx.shortest_path(). For each extracted path, we
 assign node-level structural metrics computed from the original graph. The node degree is obtained using
 networkx.degree(), betweenness centrality is computed with networkx.betweenness_centrality(), and
 closeness centrality is determined via networkx.closeness_centrality(). Each identified path is saved as
 a GraphML file using networkx.write_graphml() with these computed node attributes for further analysis.
 Decentralized Node and Relationship Reasoning. Each node vi ∈ V and each relationship eij ∈ E
 along the longest path is analyzed separately. A language model fθ is prompted with:
 LLM(vi) = fθ(“Analyze concept vi in a novel scientific context.")
 for nodes, and
 LLM(eij) = fθ(“Analyze relationship eij and hypothesize new implications.")
 for relationships. This enables independent hypothesis generation at the atomic level.
 Multi-Agent Synthesis. The set of independent insights I = {I1,I2,...} is aggregated, and a final
 inference step is performed using:
 Ifinal = fθ(“Synthesize a novel discovery from I.")
 This allows the model to infer higher-order patterns beyond individual node-relationship reasoning.
 Structured Report Generation. The final response, along with intermediate insights, is formatted into a
 structured markdown report containing:
 • The extracted longest path
 • Individual insights per node and relationship
 • The final synthesized discovery
 This approach leverages multi-step reasoning and recursive inference, allowing for emergent discoveries beyond
 explicit graph-encoded knowledge.
 4.5.1 Agent-driven Compositional Reasoning
 We employ a multi-step agentic approach that couples LLMs with graph-based compositional reasoning.
 To develop such an approach, we load the graph and locate its largest connected component. We compute
 eccentricities to identify two far-apart nodes, then extract the longest shortest path between them. Each
 node in that path becomes a “building block,” for which the LLM provides a concise definition, principles,
 and a property conducive to synergy (Step A). Next, we prompt the LLM to create pairwise synergies
 by merging adjacent building blocks, encouraging a short, compositional statement that unifies the nodes’
 respective features (Step B). To deepen the layering of ideas, we consolidate multiple synergy statements
 into bridge synergies that capture cross-cutting themes (Step C). Finally, we issue a more elaborate prompt
 asking the LLM to integrate all building blocks and synergies into an expanded, coherent “final discovery,”
 referencing both prior statements and each node’s defining traits (Step D). This process yields a multi-step
 compositional approach, wherein each synergy can build on earlier results to reveal increasingly sophisticated
 connections. The initial steps A-C are carried out using meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, whereas the
 f
 inal integration of the response in Step D is conducted using meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We
 also experimented with other models, such as o1-pro as discussed in the main text.
 4.6 Scale free analysis
 To determine whether a given network exhibits scale-free properties, we analyze its degree distribution using
 the power-law fitting method implemented in the powerlaw Python package. The algorithm extracts the
 degree sequence from the input graph and fits a power-law distribution, estimating the exponent α and lower
 bound xmin. To assess whether the power-law is a preferable fit, we compute the log-likelihood ratio (LR)
 between the power-law and an exponential distribution, along with the corresponding p-value. A network
 is classified as scale-free if LR is positive and p < 0.05, indicating statistical support for the power-law
 hypothesis. The method accounts for discrete degree values and excludes zero-degree nodes from the fitting
 process.
